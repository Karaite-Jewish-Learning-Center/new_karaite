# The Karaites Project

    The project aims to create a platform for the Karaites community to share religious books.
    The project is inspired by the [Sefaria](https://www.sefaria.org/) project, which is a platform for Jewish texts.
    The project is a work in progress and is being developed by the Karaites community.

# Features:
    - Read/listen to the bible books in Hebrew and English
    - Read/listen Payers and Songs books in Hebrew and English
    - Read/listen Polemic books in Hebrew and English
    - Read/listen Poetry books in Hebrew and English
    - Read/listen Exhortatoty books in Hebrew and English
    - Read/listen Comments books in Hebrew and English
    - Search for words in all books in Hebrew and English and link to the relevante book.
    - Books are cross-referenced with each other by comments and references.
      ex: A comment in the bible book can reference a song book, and vice versa.
    - Users can open this reference in a new pane with the relevant book text, 
      the number of panes is limited by screen space.
