    <span class="en-red">1:1 These are the matters [<em>devarim</em>]</span>
    <span class="en-black">&mdash;</span>
    <span class="en-black-text-serif">When the Israelites were about to cross the Jordan in order to divide themselves up according to their portions,
        <span class="en-black-text-theme">they required warning </span>
        and admonishment to observe the Torah, just as he exhorted them when they were traveling from Sinai to enter the land. Since events occurred that prevented them from entering, he now wishes also to articulate the impediments on account of which the warnings and admonishments must be repeated [now].
        <span class="en-foot-note" data-for="en" data-tip="[1] Some material is added from two manuscripts, without which it is very difficult to read this introductory passage.">
            <sup class="en-foot-index">[1]</sup>
        </span>
        Consequently, he begins with the word
        <em>
            <span class="en-orange">matters [</span>
        </em>
        <span class="en-orange">devarim
            <em>]</em>
        </span>, to include the subject matter of the commandments and words of rebuke. The meaning of the verse would be <em><span class="en-orange">These are the matters which Moses spoke to all of Israel across the Jordan</span></em>: what befell them <em><span class="en-orange">in the wilderness, in the wasteland, opposite Suph</span></em>, including what happened to them when they traveled from Sinai until their arrival at Kadesh Barnea. </span>
