        <span class="text-font">When the Israelites were about to cross the Jordan in order to divide themselves up according to their portions,

                and admonishment to observe the Torah, just as he exhorted them when they were traveling
                from Sinai to enter the land. Since events occurred that prevented them from entering, he now wishes also to
                articulate the impediments on account of which the warnings and admonishments must be repeated

            , to include the subject matter of the commandments and words of rebuke. The meaning of the verse would be <i>
            <span style="color:#FFC000">These are the matters which Moses spoke to all of Israel across the Jordan</span>
        </i>: what befell them <i>
            <span style="color:#FFC000">in the wilderness, in the wasteland, opposite Suph</span></i>,
        including what happened to them when they traveled from Sinai until their arrival at Kadesh Barnea.
