            "5": "On the seventh he says ‘He who answered David and Shlomo his son in Jerusalem, may He answer you and hear the voice of your cries on this day. Blessed are You, oh Lord, who has mercy on the land.’",
            "6": "GEMARA. It is written “And he said: I called out from my distress to the Lord, and He answered me…” (Yonah 2:3) There was no need to mention David and Shlomo and afterwards Yonah and Eliyahu, except in order to end with ‘who has mercy on the land.’ On the seventh: They said in the name of Sumchus ‘blessed is He who brings low the lofty.’ This makes sense regarding Shlomo, of whom it is written “I have surely built You a house to dwell in…” (Melachim I 8:13) but why David? Because he attempted to count Israel. R’ Abahu said: it is written “When I call, answer me, O God of my righteousness; in my distress You have relieved me…” (Tehillim 4:2) David said before the Holy One ‘Master of the World! Every distress into which I came, You opened it out for me. I entered into the distress of Bat Sheva, You brought me Shlomo. I entered into the distress of counting Israel, You brought me the Holy Temple."

He used to say ‘the world rests on three things – on the Torah on the Service and on Acts of Loving-kindness.’ The three of them are found in one verse (Isaiah 51:16) “And I placed My words into your mouth…” refers to Torah, “…and with the shadow of My hand I covered you…” refers to acts of loving-kindness, to teach you that anyone who is occupied with Torah and acts of loving-kindness merits to sit in the shadow of the Holy One. This is what is written “How precious is Your kindness, O God, and the sons of man will take refuge in the shadow of Your wings.” (Psalms 36:8)  “…to plant the heavens and to found the earth…” (Isaiah 51:16) this refers to the sacrifices “…and to say to Zion [that] you are My people,” (ibid.) this refers to Israel. R’ Chanina bar Pappa said: I went over all of the Scripture and did not find that Israel was called Zion except here “…and to say to Zion [that] you are My people.”"
