And why did R' Eliezer say that 7 days should be negated? It is because he needs to shave after he has been sprinkled [with purifying waters] on the 3rd and 7th days, as scripture says 'On the 7 day he should be shaved.' In principle, no days should need to be negated, since he [the Nazirite] has already counted 29 days in purity. But now, since he has been shaved while he is impure, a Rabbinic enactment goes into effect - "
