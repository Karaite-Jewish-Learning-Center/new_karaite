In a case where the sacrifice did not end up being slaughtered, the matzot may now be eaten for seven days. However, they were not intended to be the mitzva of matza but were intended to become unfit if they were not used along with the sacrifice within the timeframe of a day and a night. Rav Yosef agrees with the teaching of Rabba who requires the Matza be guarded for the sake of the mitzva and relies on the same verse as Rabba. He only argues with Rabba on this point that if he also had intention for the mitzva of matza then he would fulfill the requirement of the thanksgiving sacrifice but would not fulfill the requirement of matza that requires guarding matza that can be used for seven days."
