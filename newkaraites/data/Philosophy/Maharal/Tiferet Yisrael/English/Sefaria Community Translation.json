                "0": "One can also say that for this he held the mountain over them as a barrel, that Israel would not say, G-d forbid, that there would be an annulment of Kabbalat haTorah, because they of their own volition received the Torah and could thereby have been exempted from it. Thus G-d held the mountain over their heads like a barrel, that they would be forced to receive it. All things that are forced and necessary cannot be removed or annulled. This is proved in the Midrash wrt the verse “and she will be his wife; he cannot send her away all the days of his life.” When the Holy One came to give the Torah on Mount Sinai, he held the mountain over them like a barrel, that they would receive it. And because of this, Israel is the anusato of the Holy One, and about the anusato it is written “and she will be his wife; he cannot send her away all the days of his life.” And this is not true with respect to the seducer [who does not force himself on anyone]. The punishment of the rapist is in accordance with his act, because the rapist forced himself on the virgin and everything that is forced is essential, thus he cannot send her away since he himself forces the marital relations, he cannot ever leave. Therefore, G-d held the mountain over them like a barrel so that the connection would be essential, and every essential connection cannot be abandoned, as in the case of the rapist."

                "1": "Before we clarify this matter, it is appropriate for you to know the distinction which exists between the repetition of the Torah (Deuteronomy), where the second set of Ten Commandments are found, and the rest of the Torah. In the gemara Megillah 31b it says “…one may not interrupt the reading of the curses…Abaye said: They taught this only with regard to the curses that are in Leviticus, but with regard to the curses that are in Deuteronomy, one may interrupt. What is the reason for this distinction? These curses in Leviticus are stated in the plural, and Moses pronounced them from the mouth of the Almighty. However, these curses in Deuteronomy are stated in the singular, and Moses said them on his own.” This does not mean that, Gd forbid, Moshe said even one letter on his own. Rather it refers to the distinction between Deuteronomy and the rest of the Torah, because the Torah which God gave to Israel has two aspects – one from the perspective of God who gave the Torah and the second from the perspective of Israel who received it. If one gave something to a friend who was of equal status, then there is only one perspective because they are equals, but when God who is above all gave the Torah to Israel on earth it is impossible that there not be a special aspect to it which pertains to the giver and another which pertains to the receiver. It is fit that the rest of the Torah express the aspect of the giver while the last book of Deuteronomy express that of the receiver because one who receives does so at the end once the giver has completed their words. This is why Deuteronomy is called Mishne Torah (the repetition of the Torah) to indicate that it contains some special aspect from the perspective of the receiver, as it says “…Moses undertook to expound this Teaching…” (Deut. 1:5) This is because the one who receives needs more clarification and explanation, and this is the distinction between Deuteronomy and the rest of the Torah. In the rest of the Torah, even though Moshe spoke every word nevertheless it was as if God said that ‘thus was decreed and so commanded the Lord,’ God placed the words in Moshe’s mouth as it is written regarding the Ten Commandments “…As Moses spoke, God answered him in thunder.” (Exodus 19:19) Thus it was with everything that Moshe said – God put the words in his mouth. Deuteronomy is different, because in this book Moshe spoke his own words as a messenger who has been commanded to deliver a message. This is what the gemara means when it said ‘these curses in Deuteronomy are stated in the singular, and Moses said them on his own,’ God did not place the words in his mouth because the Deuteronomy is the receiving of the Torah and the act of receiving happens through one who is close to the receiver. The receiver is the essential element of Deuteronomy and therefore it was spoken by Moshe who was close to the receiver (i.e. Israel). The general principal is that God gave the Torah and Israel received it, and that receiving always happens at the end which is Deuteronomy. This is why the language of the book is fit to the receiver, because in it the receiver is primary – meaning that Deuteronomy came at the end to clarify the Divine message further in a manner fit to the receiver. This is a great and essential principal which answers all the difficulties posed by the differences and deviations between the first and second descriptions of the Ten Commandments. Furthermore you must know that the Torah is a covenant between God who gave it and Israel who received the covenant. A covenant binds together the one who makes the covenant with the one who receives it, and anything which connects two things from one perspective is close to one side and from another to the other. Therefore the Torah, which is the covenant between God and Israel, is from one perspective closer to God who gave the covenant and from another perspective to Israel who received it. Thus all of the Torah except Deuteronomy was spoken directly by God who made the covenant but Deuteronomy which comes at the end, which is so to speak the other extremity, is closer to Israel the receiver…"
