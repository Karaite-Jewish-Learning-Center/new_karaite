                "13": "Rav Musna (ibid) said based on the pasuk (Devarim 4:7) \"What other great nation has a G-d Who is close to them, as Hashem our G-d is whenever we call to Him.\" This means that the salvation of Israel in this redemption was from the power of prayer, for they overcame Amalek with prayer, as it says (Beraishis 27:22, Beraishis Rabba 65:16) \"'The voice is the voice of Yaakov and the hands are the hands of Esav' -- for if the voice is not the voice of Yaakov, the hands are the hands of Esav; but if the voice is the voice of Yaakov, the hands of Esav have no power.\" These words are known in the wisdom of how the voice of Yaakov defeats Amalek, as it says (Shemos 17:11) And when the hands of Moshe were strong in his prayer, Israel overpowered, and when he rested and there was no voice of Yaakov, Amalek overpowered. Onkelos there translates the pasuk the same way: When he raised his hands Israel overpowered, and when he rested, etc. We therefore see that prayer is the way to defeat Amalek, and this is the matter of the Megillah, as the very deep matters are understood. R' Ashi said on the pasuk (Devarim 4:34) \"Or has G-d done miracles to come,\" which is to say that the salvation of Israel is in that Hashem took Israel for Himself, as it says (ibid) \"to come to take for Himself a nation from within a nation.\" And because of this they were saved, for Israel is for Hashem and they are His nation. And therefore when they are given to be destroyed and murdered and entirely given over into their enemeies' hands, this is impossible, because Israel belong to Hashem, and therefore Hashem extricates them from their enemies' hands. The Midrash (Midrash Shochar Tov, Tehillim 114) explains this pasuk regarding the Exodus from Egypt as being like extricating the fetus from its mother's womb. And this is the meaning of \"Has any G-d done miracles to come take for Himself a nation from within a nation,\" using the language of \"within\" and innards. So it was here, that He extricated them from the hands of the enemy in whose hands they were given over entirely, because it is impossible for Israel to be removed from Hashem. If the king had done with them as he wished it would not have been so when they were not given over into another's hands, only when they are given over to another's hands, this matter is impossible, for Israel belongs to Hashem, and so how can they be given over into another's hands? The Midrash also explained this pasuk regarding the Exodus from Egypt for when they were in Egypt they were completely in their power, and then it says (Devarim 4:34) \"Has any G-d done miracles to come take for Himself a nation from within a nation,\" and similarly when they were given over into Haman's hands, to do with them as he wished, and then Hashem took Israel from his power. This matter teaches regarding the greatness of redemption, for when He took them from the hands of another, for Himself, this teaches regarding the complete attachment which is between them and Hashem. Not so when they were in Egypt's power, for they were not given over entirely to be destroyed in their power, but when they were given over into Haman's hands to be destroyed and Hashem took them out for Himself, this is the complete cleaving and attachment. And therefore even if all the holidays are nullified, Purim will not be nullified (Midrash Shochar Tov Mishlei 9:1). For all the holidays teach regarding the attachment and cleaving that Israel have to Hashem, and are called holidays for that reason, as in (Shemos 25:22) \"And I will set a meeting time for you from the Kapores,\" which is a language of appointment and attachment, and in the future when Israel have the attachment and cleaving to Hashem to a greater degree, this attachment which is through the medium of the holidays will be nullified. But Purim, which teaches about complete attachment and cleaving when He took them from the power of Haman, this matter will not be nullified. "
