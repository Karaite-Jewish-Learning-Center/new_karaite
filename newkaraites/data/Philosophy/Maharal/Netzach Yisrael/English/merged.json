                "0": "When a good thing is known from its opposite, that is true knowledge.  The knowledge of all things is acquired from their opposite.  It is from the appearance of black that one can gain knowledge of the appearance of white.  And smilarly with all opposites.  From one is acquired the knowledge of its opposite.  It is widely accepted that \"the knowledge of opposites is all one thing\".  Because of this, the [Sages] say in Arvei Pesachim (The final chapter of Babylonian Talmud Tractate Pesachim 116a) that in the Haggadah \"one begins with disgrace and concludes with praise\".  Why do they begin with disgrace?  Only because true praise can only be recognised from its opposite.  Therefore, we cannot explain the the concept of the final redemption [geulah], without explaining the concept of exile [galut] and churban [destruction of the temple in Jerusalem].  It is by this means that we can come to know the goodness and salvation which we hope for.  When we come to explain the concept of exile with true knowledge, we will need to start with the cause of the exile, and matters connected to the exile.",
                "1": "There is another reason to explain the concept of exile first.  The exile itself is proof and clear imperative for redemption.  This is because there is no doubt that exile is an alteration and departure from the normal order.  The Blessed Holy One arranged each nation in the place which is appropriate for it, so he arranged the People of Israel into the place which is appropriate for it, namely the Land of Israel.  Exile from their place is a complete alteration and departure [from that order].  Anything which departs from its natural place, which is outside its place, is unable to stay in the place which is not natural for it.  Rather they need to return to their natural place.  Because if they remain in a place which is unnatural for them, then the unnatural would become natural.  And it is impossible for the unnatural to become natural.  A metaphor: it is like trying to force fire to stay down, when it's natural state is to rise - or like trying to hold up solid matter, when its natural state is to fall to the earth.  If you could achieve that, then you would be making the unnatural natural.",
                "2": "Similarly with the People of Israel themselves.  If they were to stay in exile for ever, which is not the right place for them to be (since the right place for them, according to the order of existence, is the Land of Israel under their own sovereignty and not under the sovereignty of any other).  Just like everything in natural existence, each one has its own place as our sages decreed (Pirkei Avot 4:3) \"There is nothing which does not have its place\".  Each thing under its own sovereignty.  If they would remain in exile forever, then this thing (unnaturally standing outside their place) would become natural.  Only natural things can stand permanently, because the nature which the Blessed Holy One gave to each thing is what sustains it such that it is established to stand forever.  If an unnatural state of affairs were to exist forever, even though it was not according to the order and nature of existence, then the nature of that thing would be loosened and nullified completely for no purpose, and such a thing could not happen.",
                "3": "Similarly, dispersal is not a natural state of affairs.  Just as each thing returns to its place, so dispersed and separated parts have to return to [become] one entity.  This is clear to anyone of intelligence, that all parts have one essence to them.  If so, why would there be a division between them, and not unity, since they are one thing?  Therefore all dispersal stands only to be coalesced together.  Therefore the dispersal of the People of Israel among the nations is a thing which exists outside of nature, since (the People of Israel) is one nation, suitable to be standing together as one, as is found in the case of all natural things which are not divided into two.  Rather that they should be joined together.  Similarly \"All the rivers flow into the sea\" (Kohelet 1:7) to be gathered together.  One thing is not divided.  So since the Jewish nation is a nation united more than any other nation, not divided or separated , it is appropriate that they should be gathered together.  From this we can see that dispersal is particularly unnatural for them.  It is impossible to say that this state of affairs is only because of sin and iniquity, after all the dispersal of the People of Israel is so unnatural, because if this were to become permanent, then the unnatural would have to become natural.",
                "4": "Furthermore, according to the order of existence, it is not appropriate for a nation to be subjugated by another under the weight of a yoke upon it.  Because the Blessed Holy One created each nation with its own purpose.  The idea that the People of Israel should be \"higher than all the other nations of the earth\" (Deut 28:1) when they do the will of the Almighty is a separate concept, because it is the order of existence that [in those conditions] they should be on a higher level.    But in the case of the rest of the nations, according to the order of existence, it is appropriate that each one of them from the point of view of being created for its own purpose, should not be under the authority of others.  And if such a state of affairs were to exist permanently, namely the exile and the hand of other nations ruling over the People of Israel, then such a state of affairs contrary to the order of existence, an alteration in the order of the world, would be impossible. Therefore we can only understand redemption from exile.",
                "5": "The Sages hinted towards this idea, in their wisdom, in Midrash Bereishit Rabbah (44:18) [on the double language in the verse] \"G-d said to Avram you shall surely know [lit: it is known, you will know]\" (Gen 15:13)\" [The Midrash says:] \"(1) It is known that I will disperse them, you will know that I will gather them in.  (2) It is known that I will pawn them, you will know that I will reclaim them.  (3) It is known that I will subjugate them, you will know that I will redeem them.\" This Midrash did not need to express all three of these ideas, because they are all one concept.  It would have been enough for them to express [only the third one] \"It is known that I will subjugate them, you will know that I will redeem them\"  Because this is the essence which records that, in any case, that He will redeem Am Yisrael.  So why did they need to mention also the idea of (1) gathering in and (2) reclaiming?    The [Sages] wanted to express that by this double expression  the exile and redemption are hinted at.  The exile is referred to by the expression \"it is known\" and the redemption by the expression \"you will know\" in the future tense. They explain [that G-d is saying] \"it is known that I disperse them, you will know that I will gather them in\".  Because dispersal is not according to the order of existence - that a single entity, like the People of Israel which is one people, should be dispersed, as has been explained already, that things which are one are together also.  And [the Sages say] \"it is known that I will pawn them\" meaning that I will put them under the authority of others, and it is not appropriate according to the order of existence that the People of Israel should stand under any other sovereignty.  Because when the People of Israel are in another land, they leave behind their own sovereignty and stand under the authority of another.  Like a pawned object which is situated in the domain of someone other than its owner.  So with the People of Israel, who should not, according to the order of existence, be under the government of others, and that others should be subjugating them, because it was not for this that they were created.  Therefore, \"by it being known  that I will subjugate them, you will know that I will redeem them\" - take them out of the subjugation.  Because He is the One who ordered existence, it is impossible that something which comes from Him should depart from that order.  Rather something temporary arising out of the happening of a sin, because something which is a temporary punishment because of sin is not called a departure from the order of existence.  But for such a state of affairs to continue forever cannot be, because you will not find anything which departs from the natural order which sustains.  Similarly when [the Sages] said \"it is known that I will subjugate them, you will know that I will redeem them\", it is because the subjugation of one nation by another is not in accordance with the order of existence as it should be, because it should be that every nation is free.  This we have discussed at length in my book \"Gevurot Hashem\" (Chap 35) on the verse \"This month shall be for you the first of months\" (Ex 12:2)  q.v. Thus has been explained by these three ideas [being out of place, dispersal, and subjugation] that one can come to an understanding of redemption from [understanding] exile."
