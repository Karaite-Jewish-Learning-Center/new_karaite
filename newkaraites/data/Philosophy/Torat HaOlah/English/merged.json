Rabbi Yoḥanan says: These are Torah scholars, who engage in Torah study at night. The verse ascribes them credit as though they engage in the Temple service... Reish Lakish said: What is that which is written: “This is the law [torah] of the burnt offering, of the meal offering, and of the sin offering, and of the guilt offering...” (Leviticus 7:37)? [This teaches that] anyone who engages in Torah is as though he sacrificed a burnt offering, a meal offering, a sin offering, and a guilt offering... \"...And in every place offerings are presented to My name, and a pure meal offering...\" (Malachi 1:11) Do they really present offerings in every place? [Rather] these are Torah scholars, who engage in Torah in every place. [God says:] I ascribe them credit as though they burn and present offerings to My name.",
            "1": "And we say there that Torah scholars who engage in Torah are as if the Holy Temple is being built in their days.",
            "2": "In Midrash Rabbati Tzav (Pesikta Rabbati 16:1), Rav [Huna] said two things: 1) The exiles will only be gathered in through the merit of Mishna. Why? \"And while they are courting among the nations, I will gather them\" (Hosea 8:10). Rav Huna said, \"Or from where the sun rises to where it sets, My name is honored among the nations, and everywhere incense and pure oblation are offered to My name...\" (Malachi 1:11). Is it really so that a pure oblation is offered in Babylonia? Rather, this [Babylonia] refers to the Mishna. The Holy One, blessed be He, said, \"Since you engage in the Mishna, it is as if you offered a sacrifice. Shmuel said, \"When they are ashamed of all they have done [make known to them the layout of the Temple]...\" (Ezekiel 43:11). Is there a layout of the Temple to this day? Rather, the Holy One, blessed be He, said, \"Since you engage in its study, it is as if you built it.\""

                "3": "There were 11 kaftorim [on the menorah of the Mishkan], parallel to the Torah’s 11 essentials and roots, as [Rabbi Yosef Albo] the author of the Ikkarim wrote (1:15), “Using this method, we find that the essentials and roots are eleven”... And although HaRav Abarbanel, in his book Rosh Emunah, argued against  those who identify roots and essentials for Torah since we must believe in the entire Torah, his words have neither root nor essential in this. We have seen the Sages say (Makkot 23b-24a), “David came and established the Torah on ten principles, Isaiah came and established it on six, etc.”<br> And the flowers [on the menorah of the Mishkan]  were nine, parallel to nine true beliefs which every person of Torah should believe, such that one who denies any of them is called a “heretic”..."

                "0": " To return to our subject, to explain the two flowers on the right and left branches: The flower on the right branch is parallel to belief in Prayer, that one should pray to G-d and not employ any intermediary. This belief is clarified in the book of Bereishit [which is the right branch, as the first chumash]. We find that the patriarchs all prayed to G-d without any intermediary at all. The Sages already said (Berachot 26b), “The prayers were established by the patriarchs”, and we have found that Avraham prayed in the event with Sodom, and Yitzchak prayed for his wife Rivkah, and Yaakov prayed as they taught regarding Bereishit 28:11, “And he was pogeia in the place.” Note: According to the Talmud, Yitzchak’s prayer took place in the field before Rivkah arrived, in Bereishit 24:63. Rabbi Isserles seems to refer to Bereishit 25:21.]<br> This what Yaakov actually meant when he  said (Bereishit 30:1-2), “Am I in the place of G-d, who has withheld, etc.” He meant that one should not place any intermediary between himself and G-d.<br> Therefore Yaakov was angry at Rachel, for she wished to place him between her and G-d, when she said, “Grant me children.” He knew that Rachel was not irrational, thinking that Yaakov could grant children; rather, she meant that he should be an intermediary, and this was what enraged him. All of this is clear."
