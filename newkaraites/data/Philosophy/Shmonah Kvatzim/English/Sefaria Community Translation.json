It is totally impossible to come to the lofty spirit of [the daily recitation of] \"Praise the Lord, call out in His name, make known His wonders among the nations,\" without an inner love from the depths of the heart and soul to do good to all of the nations, to improve their wealth and to enrich their lives. This characteristic is that which uniquely qualifies Israel to have the spirit of the Messiah dwell upon it."

And all that is happening in the material values is happening in the spiritual ones, except that this study is late to come. And the spiritual savage thinks, that all that is read and written will feed his soul, until he come to distinguish between holy and profane, between the things that give eternal life, and the things that disrupt the course of the true life.

This rebellion against the sovereignty of silence destroys all its buildings, all the storehouse of simplicity and rectitude, of depth and transcendent communication - everything shatters in fragments. Afterwards, if one wants to rebuild that which was destroyed, they must establish everything anew, and in that moment a discerning person is silent. In truth when silence is honored in the moment of its appearance, then it asserts its rule, establishes its hall, penetrating to the deepest depths of its abyss and bringing out glorious ramifications and mighty branchings with a powerful and refreshing vital force - the shrubs (sichim) are filled with strength and new expressions of the lips (Is. 57:19) come. Then the time for speech begins, in its beautiful glory, and the spirit of silence serves as the mediating angel that works upon the flood of speech, flowing like a river in all its preciousness and abundant wealth. \"I will create new expressions of the lips: Peace, peace, both far and near, says the Lord. And I will heal him. (Is. 57:19) \"...Their fruit will serve for food and their leaves for healing.\" (Ezekiel 47:12) "

Only afterwards can it be sweetened through the power of consciousness and clarified until it takes its clean, ennobled form which is solely the hatred of wickedness, while toward those who carry it, who are the wicked themselves, we are filled with compassion. ‘Let the sins cease and not the sinners.’ (Berachot 10a) If at its inception hatred comes in its ideal form, focusing its essence only on the hatred of abstract wickedness, it will never be actualized in its full strength even as that hatred of wickedness. This is because the lack of hatred for the wicked will blur the hatred of wickedness itself, and then all the storehouse of good will be placed in great danger. This was the stumbling block for many fallen, who fell because from the beginning they employed the hatred of wickedness in its ennobled form, and the absence of hatred for the wicked afterwards was transformed into love for them. And through the love of the wicked they fell into the love of wickedness itself. Therefore, the first thought must be in the quality of the aspect of judgment, and afterwards mercy will come and sweeten it through their union. "
