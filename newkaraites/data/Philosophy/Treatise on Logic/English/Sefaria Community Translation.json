                "0": "The name, which is called in Arabic grammar \"the beginning\", is what we call in logic the subject [the Hebrew term literally means \"carrier\"]. And what is called in Arabic grammar \"the story about the beginning\", is called in logic the predicate [the Hebrew term literally means \"carried\"]. Whether the predicate is a name, a verb, or a different word, or a phrase - all that is called the predicate. It doesn't matter if the story is positive or negative. For example is we say \"Reuven stands\". \"Reuven\" is the subject. \"Stands\" - the predicate. And also \"Reuven doesn't stand\". \"Reuven\" is the subject, \"doesn't stand\" the predicate. If we say \"Reuven stood or will stand\", \"Reuven\" is the subject, \"stood or will stand\" - the predicate. And if we say \"Reuven is in the house\", \"Reuven\" - subject, \"in the house\" - predicate. And this is whatever the story is a noun, a verb, or whatever phrase - all of this is called predicate.",
                "1": "Any speech, positive or negative, made of a subject and a predicate, is called a statement [literally, \"judgement\"]. A statement always has two parts, the subject and the predicate. Even if there are a lot of words in the statement, it only has those two parts. For example, take \"Reuven the Hebrew who stood in the house of Shim'on killed the son of Laban the Aramean\". The subject is \"Reuven the Hebrew who stood in the house of Shim'on\", and the predicate is \"killed the son of Laban the Aramean\".",
                "2": "In this chapter [literally, gate] teaches the terms \"subject\", \"predicate\", and \"statement\". "

                "0": "Every sentence either connects the subject and predicate, such as:",
                "1": "\"Reuven is smart\" or \"Shimon is standing\" or  disconnects them, such as saying: \"Reuven isn't smart\" or \"Shimon did not stand\". A connecting sentence is called an affirmative sentence, and a disconnecting sentence is called a negative sentence. Sometimes the affirmative sentence connects the predicate to all subjects, such as \"every man is alive\", this is called a universal affirmative sentence. The word \"all\" is called the universal affirmative quantifier. Sometimes the affirmative sentence connects the predicate to some subjects, such as \"some men write\". This is called the particular affirmative. \"Some\" is called the particular affirmative quantifier.  Sometimes a negative sentence disconnects all subjects from the predicate, for example \"no animal is made of stone\". This is called the universal negative. \"No\" is the universal negative quantifier. Sometimes a negative sentence disconnects some subjects, for example \"not all men write\", \"some men don't write\", etc. . This is called the particular negative. This is called the particular negative quantifier. The four quantifiers are \"all\", \"some\", \"none\", and \"not all\".",
                "2": "There are four types of sentences with quantifiers: universal affirmative, particular affirmative, universal negative, and particular negative.",
                "3": "If the subject doesn't have a quantifier, such as \"the man writes\", this is a non quantified sentence. Such sentences are always particular, whether affirmative or negative. If we say \"the man writes\", it means \"some men\". If we say \"the man doesn't write\", it means \"not all men write\". If the subject is a specific individual, such as \"Reuven is alive\" or \"Shimon is smart\" or \"Levi writes\", that is a specific sentence.",
                "4": "So there are six types of sentences: universal affirmative, universal negative, particular affirmative, or particular negative. An unquantified sentence is a particular sentence, whether affirmative or negative. A specific sentence is also a particular, either affirmative or negative.",
                "5": "We call whatever the sentence says about the amount of the subject, \"the sentence's quantity\". And whatever it says about whether it is affirmative or negative, \"the sentence's quality\". For example, in \"all men are alive\" the quantity is universal and the quality is affirmative. When we say \"some men don't write\", the quantity is particular and the quality is negative.",
                "6": "These are the fourteen terms explained in this chapter: affirmative, negative, universal affirmative, particular affirmative, universal negative, particular negative, unquantified, specific, the universal affirmative quantifier, the particular affirmative quantifier, the universal negative quantifier, the particular negative quantifier, sentence quantity, and sentence quality."
