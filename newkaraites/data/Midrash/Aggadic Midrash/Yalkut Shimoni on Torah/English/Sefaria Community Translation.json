And He said: Why do you ask Me? I and you should ask the Court Below. And what is the meaning of \"like Hashem our G-d whenever we call upon Him,\"--calling upon Him is by the festivals, as it is said, \"These are the festivals of Hashem, a holy calling.\" Rav Krispa said in the name of Rav Yochanan: in the past, these were the festivals of  Hashem; from now on, it is as you call them. If you call them, they are My festivals, and if not, they are not My festivals. \"This month is for you\"--you count according to it and the nations of the world do not count according to it. Rebbi said in the name of Rabi Yehuda bar Ilai: the way of the world is that the greater count according to the greater, and the smaller count according to the smaller. Eisav, who is greater, counts according to the sun, which is greater, and Yaakov, who is smaller, counts according to the moon, which is smaller. Rav Nachman said: it's a good sign; the greater one rules during the day and does not rule at night, so too the wicked Eisav rules in This World and does not rule in the World to Come. The smaller one rules by day and by night, so too Yaakov rules in This World and in the World to Come. Rav Nachman said: all the time that the light of the greater one shines, the light of the smaller one is not noticed; when the light of the greater one sets, the light of the smaller one is noticed. So too as long as the light of Eisav is shining, the light of Yaakov is not noticed; once Eisav's light sets, the light of Yaakov is noticed, as it is said: \"Arise and give light...\" This month [is the first of months:] Rav Shmuel bar Abba said, every month that is begun from six hours or less, the eye has power to see it. From six hours or more, eyes have no power to see it. And the month that Hashem said to Moshe [Nisan 2448] was begun from above six hours, and no eye could see it; but Hashem showed it to him with a finger and said to him, \"this month....\". Rav Acha said in the name of Rav Shmuel bar Nachmani: the year that Yisrael left Egypt, the months of the year and the months of the period were equal. Rav Chiyya said in the name of Rav Yochanan: Hashem wrapped Himself in a talis with tzitzis and stood Moshe here and Aharon here, and called to Michael and Gavriel, and He made them as if they were the witnesses of the new moon. He said to them: how did you see the moon? Before the sun or after the sun? To its north or to its south?

            "2": "Another Explanation \"And first born of your children you shall redeem\" (Exodus 13:13) Where [is this law sourced:] If his father did not redeem him, he should redeem himself. [We are] taught to say: \"And all first born of my sons I will redeem\" (Exodus 13:15). Rabbi Yosei the Galilean says since the Torah said \"Redeem your sons\" and \"Teach your sons Torah\", if you learn regarding the study of Torah that if his father did not teach him he teaches himself. So to if [his father] did not redeem him he is obligated to redeem himself. [This is] not [so] if you said regarding the study of Torah that it is equal in weight to everything such that if his father did not teach him [Torah] he teaches himself. You should say regarding redemption that it is not equal in weight to everything therefore if his father did not redeem him he should not redeem himself. Behold circumcision will prove that it is not equal in weight to everything for if his father did not circumcise him he circumcises himself. So to if his father did not redeem him he should redeem himself. [This is] not [so] if you said regarding circumcision [that one who is not circumcised] is cut off [from the Jewish people] that if his father did not circumcise him he circumcises himself. You should say regarding redemption that [one who is not redeemed] is cut off [from the Jewish people] therefore if he was not redeemed he should not redeem himself. You said explain. [From] a general principal all three can be understood. Circumcision is not like Torah study and Torah study is not like circumcision and neither of them are like redemption and redemption is like neither of them. The common element between them is that they are all a command for the father to do for his son [but] if the father did not do for his son the son shall do for himself. Accordingly anything that is a command for the father to do for his son [but] if the father did not do for his son the son shall do for himself. From here they said a person is obligated from the Torah to circumcise his son, to redeem him, to teach him Torah, to teach him a craft and to marry him off. Rabbi Akiva says even to teach him to swim. Rebbi says even manners. \"It will be when your son will ask you tomorrow saying\" (Exodus 13:14) there is 'tomorrow' now [literally the next day] and there is 'tomorrow' after a [long] time. \"Tomorrow the sign shall come to pass\" (Exodus 8:19) this is tomorrow now. \"Tomorrow I will stand on top of the hill\" (Exodus 17:9) This is 'tomorrow' now. \"Tomorrow your children will say to our children\" (Joshua 22:24) This is 'tomorrow' after a [long] time. \"What mean the decrees, laws and rules\" (Deuteronomy 6:20) is found to be saying they are four sons: one wise, one simple, one wicked, and one who does not know to ask. The wise one what does he say? \"What are the decrees, laws and rules etc.\" Accordingly you say to him about the laws of Passover and say to him \"We do not have desert after the Passover sacrifice\" (Mishna Pesachim 10:8). The simple one What does he say? \"What is this?\" You shall say to him \"With a strong hand he took us out\" (Exodus 13:14). The wicked one What does he say? What is this work for you? For you and not for him and because he takes himself out of the collective his is a heretic Accordingly you take him out of the collective and say to him \"It is because of what the LORD did for me when I went free from Egypt.\" (Exodus 13:8) for me and not for him if he was there [in Egypt] he would not have been freed. And the one who does not know to ask you open for him as it says \"You shall tell your son on that day\" (ibid)."

And from where do we know that even the sea was filled with rage from Above? Because the text says \"and the waters were like rage to them\" [since the vav is missing to the word chomah, wall, it can be read as chema, rage; so you can re-read the verse as \"the water was like anger on their right and on their left\"].

It appears frequently, also in regard to converts, as Chazar M'suro.  Perhaps its a mistake here, or perhaps it is actually meant as some kind of opposite.  This translation begins in the middle, at a really cool part.] At that moment (while the people were mourning their punishment) God said to Moshe, go and bring some satisfaction to those poor ones, whose hearts have left them. Moshe said: Master of the Universe! With what can I give them satisfaction? God said back to him: Go and bring them satisfaction, with words of Torah. Which is what it means: “Speak to the Children of Israel, When you come to the land of your settlement, which I am giving to you, and you make a fire-offering to the Lord ...\" (Num 15:2,3). At that moment there was a great quarrel between the Children of Israel and the converts. Such that God had to ask Moshe: Why are they making this quarrel?! Did I not write for you all, in My Torah, “The congregation shall have one law and the stranger residing among you the same law … one Torah and one justice” (15:15,16). From here, they taught: There are three kinds of converts. There is a convert that is completely like a non-Jew, a convert that is similar to a donkey, and there is a convert just like Abraham our forefather. What kind of convert is completely like a non-Jew? He has improperly killed meat and unkosher meat in his home, but he says, I’ll go and convert so I can be amongst them. Because they have good food and they’ve got holidays and Sabbaths, and I’ll still eat these in my house. So he twists [misrepresents? pushes?] himself and goes and converts. When he then turns from the proper path, he receives punishment, for his own good, to save him from what he is doing.  The Holy One said to Israel: My children, just as he loved you, so you must love him. As it says, “And you shall love the convert” (Deut 10:19). What kind of convert is similar to a donkey? He goes to marry a Jewish woman, and they say to him, we won’t allow you to be with her unless you convert.  So he twists himself and goes and converts.  When he then turns from the proper path, he receives punishment, for his own good, to save him from what he is doing. The Holy One said to Israel: My children, just as he sought comfort from you, so shall give him comfort. As it says, “And the convert you shall not oppress” (Ex 22:20).  What kind of convert is just like Abraham our forefather?  He goes and searches out all the nations in the world.  When he sees that they too tell of the goodness of the Jewish people, he says, I will go and convert, and thus bring myself under the wings of the Shechina.  As it says, “Let no convert who has joined himself to the LORD say, ‘The LORD will surely exclude me from his people.’ (Isa 56:3)."
