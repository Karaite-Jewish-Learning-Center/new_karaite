            "6": "\"And God spoke to Moses in the Sinai Wilderness\" (Numbers 1:1). Why the Sinai Wilderness? From here the sages taught that the Torah was given through three things: fire, water, and wilderness. How do we know it was given through fire? From Exodus 19:18: \"And Mount Sinai was all in smoke as God had come down upon it in fire.\" How do we know it was given through water? As it says in Judges 5:4, \"The heavens dripped and the clouds dripped water [at Sinai].\" How do we know it was given through wilderness? [As it says above,] \"And God spoke to Moses in the Sinai Wilderness.\" And why was the Torah given through these three things? Just as [fire, water, and wilderness] are free to all the inhabitants of the world, so too are the words of Torah free to them, as it says in Isaiah 55:1, \"Oh, all who are thirsty, come for water... even if you have no money.\" Another explanation: \"And God spoke to Moses in the Sinai Wilderness\" — Anyone who does not make themselves ownerless like the wilderness cannot acquire the wisdom and the Torah. Therefore it says, \"the Sinai Wilderness.\""

And happy is the man that He has brought close, even though He has not chosen  him. And who is the one whom He has chosen? That is Avraham, as it is stated (Nehemiah 9:7), \"You are He, Lord God, Who chose Avram.\" But He did not bring him close, but rather he brought himself close. The Holy One, blessed be He, chose Yaakov, as it is stated (Psalms 135:4), \"For Yaakov did the Lord choose.\" And so [too] it says (Isaiah 41:8), \"Yaakov whom You have chosen.\" But He did not bring him close, but rather he brought himself close, as it is stated (Genesis 25:27), \"Yaakov was a simple man that sat in tents.\" He chose Moshe, as it is stated (Psalms 106:23), \"were it not for Moshe, His chosen\"; but He did not bring him close. Happy are those that the Holy One, blessed be He, chose, even though He did not bring them close. Come and see - the Holy One, blessed be He, brought Yitro close, but He did not choose him. He brought Rachav the prostitute close but He did not choose her. Happy are these that whom He brought close, even though He did not choose them. A [Roman] matron asked Rabbi Yose, \"[Does] your God bring close whomever He wants (arbitrarily)?\" [So] he brought a basket of figs in front of her and she would choose a nice one, she would choose it and eat it. He said to her, \"You know how to choose, [does] the Holy One, blessed be He not know how to choose? The one whom He sees has good deeds, He chooses him and brings him close.\" Rabbi Nechemiah [said] in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Rabbi Yitschak, \"Not all who are close are close, and not all who are distant are distant. There is one who is chosen and pushed off and brought close, [and] there is one who is chosen and pushed off and not brought close. Aharon was chosen - (I Samuel 2:28) 'And I chose him from all the tribes of Israel for Me as a priest.' And he was pushed off - (Deuteronomy 9:20) 'And with Aharon did the Lord get angry.' And it is written [after the event that the last verse cited was referring to] (Exodus 28:1), 'And you should bring close to you Aharon your brother.' Shaul was chosen - (I Samuel 10:24) 'Have you seen the one that the Lord chose?' And he was pushed off - (ibid., 15:11) 'I have regretted that I have crowned Shaul, etc.' And he was not brought close [again] - (ibid., 16:1) 'And I have been disgusted with him from ruling over Israel.' David was chosen - (Psalms 78:70) 'And He chose David, His servant.' And he was pushed off - (II Samuel 15:16-17) 'And the king went out, and all of household on his heels,... and they stood in Beit Merchak.'\" Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said, \"They excommunicated him. Nonetheless, he accepted his excommunication. This is [the meaning] of that which is written, (II Samuel 15:30) 'and David went up to the Ascent of Olives, he went up and cried, and his head was covered.'\" \"And he was brought close [again].\" Rabbi Yudan said, \"Eira Hayairi, the teacher of David, brought him close. This is what David says (Psalms 119:79), 'Let those that fear You (<i>yeirecha</i>) return to me, and they that know Your testimonies' - ['they that know'] is written as 'he that knows,' [meaning that]  Eira Hayairi was his teacher and brought [David] close.\" Rabbi Yehoshua of Sakhnin said in the name of Rabbi Levi, \"There are six that were chosen: the priesthood; the order of Levi; Israel; the monarchy of the house of David; Jerusalem; [and] the Temple.

And who is the one who is doubly happy? The one that the Holy One, blessed be He, chose and brought close.\" And who is that? That is Aharon and [the tribe of] Levi. From where [do we know this about] Aharon? Since it is written (I Samuel 2:28), \"And I chose him from all the tribes of Israel for Me as a priest.\" And from where [do we know] that He brought him close? As it is stated (Exodus 28:1), \"And you should bring close to you Aharon your brother.\" The Holy One, blessed be He chose Levi, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 18:5), \"As he was chosen by the Lord, your God.\" And from where [do we know] that He brought him close? As it is stated [here], \"Bring close the tribe of Levi, and stand [it up].\" And about them the verse (Psalms 65:5) says, \"Happy is the one whom You have chosen and You have brought close, who dwells in your courtyards\"; as you say (Numbers 3:7), \"And they shall keep his charge, and the charge of the whole congregation, etc.\"   [The continuation of Psalms 65:5 is:] \"let us be satiated from the good of Your house\" - that thy would eat from the tithes that were brought to the [Temple], as you would say (Numbers 18:21), \"To the house of Levi, behold, I have given all tithe in Israel for an inheritance, etc.\"  "

'They shall grow as grain' in [the study of] Talmud. 'Shall blossom as vine' in [the study of] Aggadah. 'His memory/scent shall be as the wine of Lebanon' - said the Holy One of Blessing: \"The appreciation of the gerim is as dear to me as the wine that was poured on the altar [as libation.]\" And why does He call it [the altar] Lebanon (root LVN)? Because it whitens (maLViN) the sins of Israel like snow, as it is written (Isaiah 1:18) 'though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.' Rabi Shimon Bar Yochai says: because all the hearts (LeVavot) become happy due to it. As it says (Psalms 48:2): 'Fair in situation, the joy of the whole earth.' And the rabbis say - because of the verse (II Kings 9:3) 'and My eyes and My heart shall be there perpetually.' Another interpretation: 'they will grow as grain' - they will make the essence, they are like Israel; as it is said (Zechariah 9:17) 'grain [for] the young men [of Israel]'. 'They shall blossom as vine', as [just like] Israel, as it says (Psalms 80:9) 'You plucked a vine from Egypt.' And so you find that, just as a portion of the Torah was written regarding one Israel and another - that if he misappropriated something of him, that he is obligated to a sacrifice, as it is written (Leviticus 5:21) 'If any one sin, and commit a trespass etc.' - so too you find that the Holy One of Blessing wrote a portion of the Torah regarding what goes on between Israel and gerim, that if a man from Israel steals from a ger, the judgement is as if he stole from another man from Israel. You find that regarding this it is written 'a sin that he sinned' and regarding stealing from a ger it is written 'from any sins of a man.' Regarding this one it is written 'and trespassed a trespass against the Lord' and regarding this one it is written 'to trespass a trespass against the Lord.' Regarding this one it is written: 'And it will be, when he sins and is guilty' and regarding the ger it is written 'and that soul will be guilty'. Regarding this one it is written: 'And he will pay with his head' and regarding the ger it is written 'and he will return his guilt with his head'. Regarding this one it is written: 'and he will add his fifth' and regarding the ger it is written 'and he will add a fifth'. Regarding this one it is written: 'and he will bring his guilt-offering to the Lord' and regarding stealing a ger it is written 'besides the ram for the kipurim'. Behold we have learned: that the essence of the gerim is like Israel's. Therefore, they will be as grain and blossom."

            "15": "<b>On the second day, brought (<i>hikriv</i>) Netanel, etc.:</b> Why does it state, \"brought\" [only with Netanel]? Because Reuven came and appealed: He said, “It is enough that Yehudah should precede me with the encampments; I should bring [next] based on the order of birth! Moshe rebuked him and said to him, “It is from the mouth of the Holy One, blessed be He, that it was told to me – bring (<i>hakrev</i>, which is the <i>ketiv</i> – the way the word is spelled in the Torah) from the [order of the] encampments!” Another explanation: <i>Hikriv</i> (which also means ‘he put him forward’) – Moshe put him forward against the will of Reuven. Another explanation: As if he brought first (even before Yehudah). Why is this so? Since he merited to have the counsel of the princes [to offer wagons], the verse counts it as if he were the first one to bring [it] up. Abba Chanan says in the name of Rabbi Eliezer, “Since he merited to have the counsel, he merited to have understanding given to his tribe, as it is stated (I Chronicles 12:33), ‘And from the children of Yissachar, who know understanding of times.’” And it is stated (Judges 5:15), “And Yissachar’s chiefs were with Deborah, etc.” And so does the verse recount his praise in the courts in Egypt, as it is stated (Numbers 26:24), “To Yashuv was the Yashuvite family” – and Yashuv is always [referring to] courts, as it is stated (Ezekiel 33:31), “They will come to you in crowds and sit (<i>yeshvu</i>) before you, etc.”; “and Yaakov was a simple man who sits (<i>yoshev</i>)  in tents” (Genesis 25:27), and it states (Deuteronomy 33:18), “and Yissachar in his tents.” <b>Brought his sacrifice, etc.</b> –  Rabbi Pinchas be Yair said, “Why did it add [the word,] <i>hikriv</i> and remove [the letter,] <i>yod</i>? Rather it is corresponding to the red heifer that they made that day. Therefore, it added [the word,] <i>hikriv</i> missing <i>yod</i>, and left the word with four letters – corresponding to the four things that the heifer required: red, complete, without a blemish, without the carrying of a yoke. As you would say (Numbers 19:2), ‘and they shall take to you a red heifer that is complete, etc.’” <b>One silver bowl</b> – the prince of Yissachar came and brought the offering for the sake of the Torah; as they love the Torah more than the other tribes, as it is stated (I Chronicles 12:33), “And from the children of Yissachar, who know understanding of times, etc.” What is “of times?” Rabbi Tanchuma said, “ Of holidays.” Rabbi Yose said, “Of intercalations.” [This verse in Chronicles continues,] “to know what Israel shall do” – on which day they shall make the holidays. [And further in the verse,] “their heads are two hundred” – these are the two hundred leaders of the Sanhedrin groomed by the tribe of Yissachar. [Still in the verse,] “and all of their brothers according to their mouths” – that they would agree to the law based on their mouths. And it states (Genesis 49:15), “bent his shoulder to haul” – since they would haul the yoke of Torah. [The verse in Genesis continues] \"and he will be a conscripted worker\" - as anyone who was mistaken in the law would ask it to the tribe of Yissachar and they would clarify it for them. <b>A silver bowl</b> – corresponding to the Torah that is called ‘bread,’ as it stated (Proverbs 19:5), “Come repast on my bread.”  And it is said about the showbread  (Exodus 25:29), “And you shall make its bowls and its ladles”; and we learned, “its bowls”  - these are the molds, as they would make the showbread in molds. <b>One hundred and thirty was its weight</b> – go out and calculate: twenty-four books of the written Torah and eighty from the Mishnah; which begins with [the letter,]  <i>mem</i> (which has a numerical equivalent of forty), “<i>me’imatai korin et haShema</i>, etc. and ends with <i>mem, “Hashem yivarech et amo be’shalom”</i>.  <i>Mem</i>  is forty and [another] <i>mem</i> is forty; behold eighty, [so] one hundred and four, as this is the count that the written Torah and the oral Torah come to. Another explanation: The beginnings of the six Orders of the Mishnah – the first letters come to eighty. Go out and calculate: <i>Mem</i> (forty) from “<i>me’imatai</i>” from the Order of Seeds; <i>yod</i> (ten) from “<i>yitziot haShabbat</i>” from the Order of Appointed Time; <i>chet</i> (eight) from “<i>chamesh-esreh nashim</i>” from the Order of Women; one (<i>alef</i>) from “<i>arbaah avot nezikin</i>” from the Order of Salvations (Damages); <i>caf</i> (twenty) from “<i>kol haZevachim</i>” from the Order of Holy Things; one (<i>alef</i>) from “<i>avot haTumaot </i>” from the Order of Purities - behold eighty, [so] from here [you see that] the count of the written Torah and the oral Torah come to one hundred and four. And it was given in twenty-six generations which were from Adam to Moshe, through whom the Torah was given – behold, one hundred and thirty. Hence the weight of the bowl was one hundred and thirty. <b>One basin of silver</b> – corresponding to the Torah which is compared to wine, as it is stated (Proverbs 9:5), “and drink from the wine that I have mixed.” And since it is the custom of wine to be drunk form a basin, as you say (Amos 6:6), “Who drink from wine basins” – therefore, he brought “a basin that is seventy shekel of the holy shekels.” Why? Just like the numerical equivalent of wine is seventy, so too are there seventy faces to the Torah. Why does it state “one” about the bowl? Corresponding to the Torah that must be one, as you say (Numbers 15:16), “One Torah and one statute shall there be for you.” Why does it state “one” about the basin? Because the words of the written Torah and the words of the Oral Torah were all given by one shepherd – all of them were stated by one God to Moshe at Sinai. Why were they of silver? Corresponding to the Torah, about which it is stated (Psalms 12:7), “The words of the Lord are pure words, silver purged in a crucible, etc.” <b>Both of them filled with fine flour, etc.</b> – Scripture and Mishnah are full, since one does not contradict its fellow. <b>Fine flour</b> – as you say (Psalms 19:11), “drippings (<i>nofet</i>) of the comb” – like flour that one can see on top of the sieve (<i>napah</i>). <b>Mixed with oil</b> – that is Torah, which is required to be mixed with good deeds; like that which we learned (Avot 2:2),” Excellent is the study of the Torah together with a worldly occupation; for the exertion [expended] in both of them causes sin to be forgotten.” That is <b>for the offering</b> – as at that time, he brings a pleasantness of spirit to his Creator, when a man is involved in Torah study and is a master of good deeds and guards himself from sin. <b>One ladle</b> – corresponding to the tablets that were written by the hand of the Holy One, blessed be He, as you say (Exodus 32:16), “The tablets were God’s work, and the writing was God’s writing, etc.” <b>Ten of gold</b> – these are the ten statements (commandments) that were written on the tablets, as you say (Deuteronomy 10:4), “And He wrote on the tablets like the first writing, etc.” <b>Gold</b> – like you say (Song of Songs 5:14), “His hands are rods of gold”; and it states (Psalms 19:11), “More precious than gold, etc.” <b>Full of incense</b> – since the six hundred and thirteen commandments are mixed in them. And so do you find that there are six hundred and thirteen letters from “I” (the first word in the ten commandments) to “of your friend” (the last word), corresponding to the six hundred and thirteen commandments; and there are seven letters lacking, corresponding to the seven days of creation – to teach you that the whole world was only created in the merit of the Torah. That is <b>full of incense (<i>ketoret</i>)</b> – since the [letter] <i>kof</i> changes to a <i>dalet</i> [in] <i>at-bash gar-dak</i> (switching the early letters in the aleph-bet with the corresponding later letters), and the [numerical] count of the word then comes to six hundred and thirteen. Another explanation: <b>full of incense</b> – as between each and every statement written on the tablets, the sections and the details were written. And it comes out like that which Chananiah the son of the brother of Rabbi Yehoshua said: “His hands are rods of gold” – these are the two tablets of the covenant upon which were written, ‘written by the finger of God.' “Rods of gold” – just like these rods, between one large rod and another large rod, there are small rods; so too, between each and every statement, the sections of the Torah were written and its details. <b>One bull of the herd</b> – corresponding to the priests; <b>one ram</b> – corresponding to the Levites; <b>one lamb</b> – corresponding to Israel, as they all accepted the Torah as Sinai. <b>One goat for a sin offering</b> – corresponding to the converts that would convert in the future and were there; as everyone is fitting, as it is stated (Leviticus 18: 5), “which a man shall do and live by them.” It does not state, “priests, Levites and Israelites,” but rather “a man.” [This] teaches that, behold, even an idolater that converts and is involved in Torah is like a high priest. <b>And for peace offerings, two oxen (<i>bakar</i>)</b> – corresponding to the two Torahs; as anyone who checks (<i>mevaker</i>) and sacrifices his inclination to do everything that is written in them is making peace twice – peace above and peace below; as it is stated (Isaiah 27:5), “But if he holds fast to My refuge, peace will he make with Me, with Me he will make peace.” <b>Five rams, five he-goats, and five yearling lambs</b> - corresponding to three verses of the Torah in which the six Orders of the Mishnah are [indicated]. And they are [each] of two sections, and each and every section is made of five words, and these are them (Psalms 19:8-10): “The Torah of the Lord is perfect, restoring the soul; the decrees of the Lord, etc.... The ordinances of the Lord, etc.; the commandments of the Lord, etc.... The fear of the Lord, etc.; the judgments of the Lord, etc.” Hence they offered these three types of sacrifices as peace offerings, corresponding to the three verses in which the six Orders of the Mishnah are [indicated]. It comes out like that which Rabbi Tanchuma said: “The Torah of the Lord is perfect, [restoring the soul], etc.” – this is the Order of Women that warns a man to separate from sexual prohibitions in order to save him from death, like the one that says (Proverbs 5:19), “All who go to her cannot return and find again the paths of life.” And it states (Proverbs 5:16), “It will save you from the forbidden woman, etc.” “The decrees of the Lord [are trustworthy], etc.” – this is the Order of Seeds, as one has trust in the world’s Life and sows. “The ordinances of the Lord, [are just, rejoicing the heart], etc.” – this is the Order of Appointed Time that has all of the holidays in it, about which it is written (Deuteronomy 16:14), “And you shall rejoice in your holidays.” “The commandments of the Lord [are lucid, making the eyes light up,]. etc.” – this is the Order of Holy Things, which enlightens the eyes [to differentiate] between profane things and holy things. “The fear of the Lord [is pure], etc.” – this is the Order of Purities, which separates between purity and impurity. “The judgments of the Lord, etc.” – this is the Order of Damages, in which there are most of the laws.  And hence they offered five of each type corresponding to the five words written for each and every Order. And why were five words written for each and every order? Corresponding to the Torah which is five books, [in order] to teach you that [the sections of the Mishnah] are bodies of Torah. Why is the name of the Holy One, blessed be He, written in [the section of the verse relating to] each and every Order? Since He testifies upon them, that He stated them to Moshe from His mouth, in the same way that He stated the five books of the Torah. <b>That was the offering of Netanel, etc.</b> - once the Holy One, blessed be He, saw that he brought offerings according to the Orders of the Torah, He began to praise his sacrifice – “that was the offering of Netanel son of Tzuar.”"

            "3": "Another reading: \"When you raise up\". You see that Moshe struggled [nitkasha] with the design of the Menorah more than all the other vessels of the Mishkan [Tabernacle], until the Holy One Who is Blessed showed him with a finger. Similarly with the hoofs of impure and pure animals, as it says, \"These are the animals which you shall eat\" (Vayikra 11:4), these are the ones which you shall not eat, and showed him with a finger. Similarly with the moon, \"this month is for you\" (Shmot 12:2). Similarly with the Menorah, \"This is how the Menorah was made: it was hammered work [miksha] of gold\" (Bemidbar 8:4), which is to say how hard [kasha] it is to make, since Moshe became weary on account of it. When he struggled, The Holy One Who is Blessed said to Moshe: take a talent of gold and throw it in the fire and take it out, and it will be formed on its own, as it says, \"its cups, calyxes, and petals were of one piece with it [lit: came out from it]\" (Shmot 37:17) - he would strike it with a hammer and it would be made on its own. Therefore it says \"it will be made [te'aseh] of hammered work\" (Shmot 25:31) written with a [Hebrew letter] \"yod\" and not written \"you will make [ta'aseh]\", that is to say it will be made on its own. Moshe took the talent [of gold] and threw it in the fire. Moshe said, \"Master of the Universe, behold the talent is in the fire. Whatever you wish - so shall it be done.\" The Menorah immediately came out made according to its design, thus it is written, \"According to the pattern that the LORD had shown Moses...\" (Bemidbar 8:4). It is not written here \"so did Moses make the Menorah,\" rather \"so was the Menorah made.\" And who made it? The Holy One Who is Blessed. Therefore the Holy One Who is Blessed said to Moshe: If you are careful to light [it] before me, I will protect your souls from every evil thing, since souls are compared to a candle, as it says. \"the candle of Adonai is the soul of a person\" (Proverbs 20:27) and it says, \"When you raise up the candles)\" (Bemidbar 8:2)",
            "5": "The Midrash Rabba (Bamidbar 15:5) relates that when the Jews were given the commandment to kindle the Menorah in the Temple (Bamidbar 8:2), they asked G'd why He told them to light up for Him Who is the Light of the whole world. G'd said to them, \"You are right. I do not need your light. But I want to give you an opportunity to light for Me like I have lit for you.\" G'd led the Jewish people with a cloud of glory and a pillar of fire. This is why He told them to kindle the lights when the Tabernacle was erected. \"This will elevate your position amongst the nations. They should say, look how the Jewish nation lights for the One who lights up the whole world.\" [...] The Midrash explains that this can be compared to a seeing person who leads a blind person as they travel along the road together. When they come to the house, the seeing person says to the blind one, \"Please go and light a candle for me.\" To this the blind person replies, \"I do not understand. As long as we were travelling, you supported and guided me. Why do you now ask me to light a candle for you?\" To this the seeing person responds, \"I want to give you an opportunity to pay me back so that you do not feel an ongoing debt of gratitude\".",
            "6": "Another explanation, \"at the front of the menorah, let the seven lights give light\" (Numbers 8:2), so that they shouldn't dishonour the menorah. (Zechariah 4:10) \"Does anyone scorn a day of small [beginnings]? When they see the stone of distinction in the hand of Zerubavel they shall rejoice over these seven\". \"These\" -- this is the menorah. \"Seven\" -- these are the seven lights, corresponding to the seven stars that wander in all the land [planets?]. So they are beloved that they are not disgraced on them, for this it says \"at the front of the menorah let the seven lights give light\" -- so that they should not become mistaken to you, and you should need to say that He needs light, see that which is written of windows (Ezekiel 40:16) \"The recesses—and their supports—had windows with frames on the interior [of the gate complex on both sides]\" etc., and so \"the interiors [of the vestibules also had windows on both sides]\" (ibid.) were like these windows. 'Like windows' is not written here, rather, \"like the windows\", that they should be wide from the outside and narrow from within, so that they would bring in light from outside. Rabbi Berachyah the kohen said in the name of Rabbi, this lightning is offspring of the fire from above, and it comes out and lights the whole world, as it says (Ezekiel 1:13) \"Such then was the appearance of the creatures. With them was something that looked like burning coals of fire. This fire, suggestive of torches, kept moving about among the creatures; the fire had a radiance, and lightning issued from the fire.\" And lights the whole world, and I need their light. And why did I tell you? To deceive you. Rabbi Chanina said, the Holy Blessed one said \"Eyes have black and white [parts] in them, and you don't see from the white but rather from the black [parts], and so if your eyes that have black and white within them only see with the black, the Holy Blessed One is  entirely Light and needs to light them. Another explanation, \"at the front of the menorah\", flesh and blood kindle a light from another light, since they are unable to create light from darkness, as it says (Genesis 1:2) \"Darkness was over the face of the deep\". Why is it written after this (Genesis 1:3) \"And God said, \"Let there be light\"\" and from the midst of the darkness brought forth light. And I need to light them, and I didn't say to you except to bring you up -- (Exodus 27:20) \"to set up the eternal light\" .",
            "7": "Another interpretation, \"at your setting up\" (Numbers 8:2). This is what the verse says (Psalms 139:12) \"Darkness is not dark for You; night is as light as day; darkness and light are the same\". And to us He says \"at your setting up\" -- to what is the matter similar? To a king who had a loved one. The king said, \"know that I will eat with you, so go and prepare for me\". The loved one went and prepared an ordinary couch, an ordinary lamp [menora], an ordinary table. When the king came, he brought his assistants around him and a golden lamp before him. When the loved one saw all the glory of the king, he became ashamed and hid all he had prepared for the king, since they all were ordinary. The king said to him, \"Did I not tell you I would eat with you? Why have you prepared nothing for me?\" The loved one said to him, \"I saw all the glory that you came with, and I was ashamed and hid all I had prepared for you, for they were all ordinary things.\" The king said to him, \"By your life [I swear] that I will ruin all my things that I brought with me, and for the sake of your love I will not use anything except your possessions!\" And so, the Holy Blessed One is entirely light, as it is said (Daniel 2:22) \"And light dwells with Him\", and God says to Israel \"Prepare for me a menorah and lights\". Why is written there (Exodus 25:8) \"And they will make me a Mikdash and I will dwell in their midst\", (Exodus 25:31) \"And make Me a menorah of pure gold\"? So when you make it, the Shechina comes. Why is it written there (Exodus 40:35) \"And Moshe was not able to enter the Tent of Meeting\", immediately [God] called to Moshe (Numbers 7:89) \"When Moshe went into the Tent of Meeting to speak with Him, he would her the Voice speaking\". What would it speak to him? \"At your setting up of the lights\".",
            "10": "Rabbi Levi son of Rabbi says: A pure Menorah came down from heaven, as The Holy One Who is Blessed said to Moshe \"You will make a Menorah of pure gold [alt: a pure Menorah of gold]\" (Shmot 25:31) [Moshe] responded: how will we make it? [God] responded \"It will be made of hammered work [mikshah]\" (Shmot 25:31). Nevertheless, Moshe struggled [nitkasha] and went down and forgot its manner of work. He went up and said: My Master, how will we make it? [God] said \"It will be made of hammered work.\" Nevertheless, Moshe struggled and went down and forgot. He went up and said: My Master, I forgot it. [God] showed Moshe and Moshe still struggled. [God] said to him: \"See and do\" (Shmot 25:40), and took a Menorah of fire and showed him how it was made. Nevertheless, it was a struggle for Moshe. The Holy One Who is Blessed said to him: Go to Betzalel, and he will make it. [Moshe] told Betzalel and he immediately made it. He was amazed and said: For me, how many times did the Holy One Who is Blessed show me and I struggled to make it, but for you, who never saw it, you make it from your thoughts! Betzalel, you were standing in the shadow of God [b'tzel el] when the Holy One Who is Blessed showed me how to make it. Therefore, when the Temple was destroyed, the Menorah was hidden. And this is one of the five things that was hidden: the ark, the Menorah, the fire, the holy spirit, and the cherubs. When the Holy One Who is Blessed returns in [God]'s mercy and builds [God]'s house and sanctuary, [God] will bring them back to their place to make Jerusalem rejoice, as it says, \"The arid desert shall be glad, The wilderness shall rejoice\" (Isaiah 35:1), \"It shall blossom abundantly, It shall also exult\" (Isaiah 35:2)."

Just like a father is obligated to circumcise his son, G-d did so for the Jews by circumcising them by the hand of Yehoshua as it says (Joshua 5:2) \"Make for yourself stone knives.\" A father is obligated to redeem his son [if he is a firstborn] and G-d redeemed the Jews, as it says [II Samuel 7:23) \"to redeem it as a nation.\" [A father is obligated] to teach [his son] Torah, [and] G-d taught the Jews Torah as it says (Deuteronomy 11:19) \"Teach them to your children\" and it is written \"I am G-d your teacher.\" [A father is obligated] to teach [his son] mitsvot, [and] G-d taught the mitsvot to the Jews. [A father is obligated] to marry [his son] to a woman, [and] G-d told mankind: \"Be fruitful and multiply.\" A father is obligated to his son [in the following ways]: to give him food and drink, to bathe him, to give him ointments, and to clothe him, and thus did G-d for the Jews, as it is written (Ezekiel 16: 9) \"And I washed you in water, and I washed away your blood...and I clothed you with embroidered clothing...and My bread which I gave you...\" [and in Numbers 21:17] \"Arise, o well, sing to it.\" What does a father give to a son? Possessions. Thus G-d did for the Jews, as it says in Jeremiah 3:18, \"And I gave you a beloved land.\" And what must a son give to his father? A gift.

The Holy Blessed One sowed the Torah and the commandments in order that the Jews would inherit them to life in the world to come. And God did not leave a thing in the world without giving a mitzvah about it to the Jews. Going out to plough: (Deuteronomy 22:10) \"Do not plough with an ox and a donkey together\". To sow: (Deuteronomy 22:9) \"Do not sow your vineyard [with two different species]\". To harvest: (Deuteronomy 24:19) \"When you reap your harvest [and forget a sheaf, leave it in the field for the poor\". Kneading: (Numbers 15:20) \"The first yield of your baking, [you shall set aside] a loaf [as a gift]\". Slaughter: (Deuteronomy 18:3) \"And give the priest the shoulder and the cheeks\". A birds' nest: sending away the mother bird. Animals and birds: (Leviticus 17:13) \"And slaughter, and cover the blood with dust\". Seedlings: (Leviticus 19:23) \"And you shall regard its fruit as forbidden\". Graves of the dead: (Deuteronomy 14:1) \"Do not gash yourselves\".

Covering oneself with a shawl: \"And you shall make for yourselves tzitzit\". And you shall make -- make, and not from a thing already made. That you should not go out numbered and make from them, rather, the commandment is to bring white and techelet and make. When? When there is techelet, and now we do not have anything but white, since the techelet has been lost (\"nignaz\", lit. stored away, like in a geniza). (Numbers 15:38) \"On the corners\" -- and not in the middle, but on the corner. (ibid.) \"A twisted thread\" -- that one needs to twist them.

[The letter] <i>ayin</i> (with a numerical count of seventy corresponds to the number of offspring he took to Egypt), \"with seventy souls\" (Deuteronomy 10:22). <i>Kof</i> corresponds to the [number of the] letters of the blessing [that he received minus the name of God, \"And may He give you etc.\" (Genesis 27:28)]. [The letter] <i>bet</i> (with a numerical count of two) remains, corresponding to two angels (that he saw on the ladder in his dream) rising. There were six hundred and thirteen commandments in the tablets - corresponding to the letters from \"I am\" (Exodus 20:2) to \"to your neighbor\" (Exodus 20:14) - corresponding to the six hundred and thirteen commandments - no less and no more. And they were all given to Moshe at [Mount] Sinai; and in them are statutes and judgments, Torah and Mishnah, Talmud and aggadah. \"The fear of the Lord is his treasure\" (Isaiah 33:6). There is no greater characteristic than fear and humility, [as it is stated] (Deuteronomy 10:12), \"And now Israel, what does the Lord, your God, ask of you besides to fear Him [...].\" \"The fear of\" (<i>Yirat</i>) has a numerical value of six hundred and eleven; and Torah has a numerical value of six hundred and eleven - and Torah and fear [of God] along with them, behold that is six hundred and thirteen. [The numerical value of] fringes (<i>tsitsit</i>) [is six hundred] - the rabbis taught: [Add] eight [strings] and five [knots], behold that is six hundred and thirteen. The days of Avraham were one hundred and seventy-five years, [of] Yitzchak were one hundred and eighty years [and of] Yaakov were a hundred and forty-seven years. When you put them together, it is found to be five hundred and two years. And so is the distance of the the heavens to the earth, \"like the the days of the heavens above the earth\" (Deuteronomy 11:21). \"[The man (David)] raised on high\" (II Samuel 23:1) - [high (<i>al</i>) has a numerical value of one hundred] corresponding to one hundred blessings. As on every day, one hundred men of Israel were dying. [So] David came and ordained [the daily saying of] one hundred blessings. Once he ordained them, the pestilence ceased. High (<i>al</i>) [corresponds to] the yoke (<i>ulah</i>) of Torah and the yoke of suffering. \"Forgive all guilt and take the good (<i>tov</i>) that we pay with the words of our lips\" (Hosea 14:3). Israel said, \"Master of the world, at the time that the Temple existed, we would offer a sacrifice and be cleansed. But now all we have in our hand is prayer.\" The numerical value of <i>tov</i> is seventeen. Prayer [consists of] nineteen blessings. Take away from them the blessing for the malfeasers that was composed at Yavneh, and \"Let the sprout of David blossom,\" which they ordained after it for the sake of \"Probe me, Lord, and try me\" (Psalms 26:2). Rabbi Simon says, \"Take <i>tov</i> [in <i>at-bash</i> (matching letters based on how close they are to the center of the alphabet), which is the same] as the numerical value of soul (<i>nefesh</i>). Israel said, 'At the time that the Temple existed, we would incinerate the fats and the innards and be cleansed. But now behold our fat, our blood and our souls. May it be Your will that it be atonement for us and \"that we pay with the words of our lips\" (Hosea 14:3).'\" \"And the Lord gave her conception (<i>herayon</i>)\" (Ruth 4:13). [<i>Herayon</i>] has a numerical value of two hundred and seventy one (the number of the days of the nine months of birthing).  The measure of the water of a mikveh (ritual bath) is forty <i>seah</i> [corresponding to the forty mentions] of well water, written in the Torah. And [the volume of] how many eggs is the measure of the mikveh? Five thousand seven hundred and sixty. Each <i>seah</i> is a hundred and forty-four eggs. Forty-three and a fifth eggs is the measure of [what is required for] <i>challah</i> [tithe]. And from where [do we know] that a mikveh requires forty <i>seah</i>? As it is written (Isaiah 8:6), \"Since this nation has rejected the waters of Shiloach that flow gently (<i>le'at</i>).\" The numerical value [of <i>le'at</i>] is forty. And one who separates the  measure of the <i>challah</i> [tithe] must separate one part in forty three and a fifth from Torah writ like the [numerical] value of <i>challah</i>. The  main categories of work [on Shabbat] are forty minus one (thirty-nine), as it is written (Exodus 35:1), \"These (<i>eleh</i>) are the things which the Lord commanded.\" [The numerical count of] \"<i>eleh</i>\" is thirty-six; \"things\" (being plural) is two; \"the things\" [indicates an additional] one - behold, forty minus one. \"He shall strike him forty, he shall not add\" (Deuteronomy 25:3), corresponds to the forty curses that the snake, Chava, Adam and the ground were cursed - and the sages lessened one, because of \"he shall not add.\" Those [judges] advocating innocence are more those advocating guilt. [For] it is best for the two to come and push off one. Seshach is Bavel (Babylon) [according to] its numerical value in <i>at-bash</i>. Tavel is Ramlah [according to] its numerical value in <i>al-bam</i> (another numerical scheme). \"Thus (<i>bezot</i>) shall Aaron enter the shrine; with a bull of the herd for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering\" (Leviticus 16:3). <i>Bezot</i> (which has a numerical count of four hundred and ten) is a hint to the first Temple that stood for four hundred and ten years.",

And it blossomed on its own, as it is stated (Numbers 17:23), \"behold the staff of Aharon sprouted.\" And some say that Moshe took one beam, cut it into twelve boards and said to them, \"All of you, take your stick from one source.\" And for what did he do this? \"It is honorable for a man to desist from strife, but every fool becomes embroiled\" (Proverbs 20:3) - so that they not say, \"His stick was damp and [so] flowered.\" And the Holy One, blessed be He, decreed about the stick; and the explicit name [of God] that was on the diadem (<i>tsits</i>) was upon it, as it is stated (Numbers 17:23), \"and a flower came out and it blossomed a blossom (<i>tsits</i>).\" And it flowered at night and made a fruit. \"And it put out (<i>yigmol</i>) almonds (<i>shekedim</i>) - it granted good (<i>gamal</i>) upon anyone who was constant (<i>shakad</i>) with the tribe of Levi. Why almonds and not pomegranates or nuts? Because Israel was compared to them. And that staff was in the hand of each and every king until the Temple was destroyed and it was hidden. And this staff will be in the hand of the king Messiah in the future, quickly in our days - as it is stated (Psalms 110:2), \"The Lord will stretch forth from Zion your mighty staff; hold sway over your enemies.\" "

Likewise, when they crossed the Jordan, all of the Children of Israel entered between the staves of the ark, as it says (Joshua 3): \"Joshua said to the Children of Israel, come near and listen to the words of Hashem.\" [Similarly] here all of Israel were standing and seeing all of the miracles of the rock. They began to say \"Moses knows the rule of the rock. If he asks, it will bring forth water.\" So Moses was uncertain -- \"If I listen to them I nullify the words of the Allpresent, and the Holy One (Job 5:13) 'takes the wise in theןr craftiness.'\" But Moses had been careful for 40 years not to get angry at them, because he was terrified of the oath the Holy One swore: \"Not one of these men will see [the land]...\" They said to him: \"Here is a rock; just as you want to bring forth water from another rock, bring it forth from this one.\" He shouted at them \"Hear now, you rebels!\" \"Rebels (morim)\" has many meanings: 1) \"stubborn ones\" 2) \"fools\" -- in the sea villages they call fools \"morim\". 3) \"those who teach their teachers\" 4) \"archers\" (In I Sam 31:3 the word \"morim\" is used to mean \"archers\".)  ...

The snake, even if it partakes of all the delectable foods of the world, they turn into dust in its mouth, as it says (Isaiah 65:25): \"And a snake, dust is its bread\" - but these [the Jews] eat man, which turns into many flavors, as it says (Psalms 106:15): \"And He gave to them what they asked\", and it says (Devarim 20:7): \"For these forty years Hashem your God has been with you; you have not lacked anything\" - the snake, which eats many things and taste one taste, should come punish these who eat one thing and taste many tastes.",

And so [was it] with Jacob - \"and Jacob feared\" (Genesis 32:8). Why did he fear?

And why did he fear? He said, \"Maybe Israel misappropriated [some goods] in the war with Sichon or became tarnished with a sin.\" The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, \"Do not fear\"...",
            "32": "33 Another interpretation of (Numb. 21:17), \"Then Israel sang\": This is one of the three things that Moses said before the Holy One, blessed be He, and He said [back] to him, \"You have taught me.\" He said in front of Him, \"Master of the Universe, from where does Israel know what they did (was wrong)? Did they not grow up in Egypt? And all of Egypt are idolaters. And when You gave the Torah, You did not give it to them, and they were also not standing there, as it is stated (Exod. 20:18), 'And the people stood from afar.' And You only gave it to me, as it is stated (Exod. 24:1), 'And He said to Moses, \"Ascend to the Lord.'\" And when You gave the statements (Ten Commandments), You did not give [them] to them. You did not say, 'I am the Lord, your (plural) God'; but rather I am the Lord, your (singular) God. [Hence] You said it to me. Did I sin?\" The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, \"By your life, you have spoken well. You have taught Me! From now on, I will say the expression, 'I am the Lord, your (plural) God.'\" The second one is when the Holy One, blessed be He, said ( in Numb. 34:7), \"visiting the iniquity of the parents upon the children\": Moses said, \"Master of the Universe, how many evildoers begat righteous ones; should they be removed by the iniquities of their parents? Terach was an idol-maker, but his son, Abraham, was righteous; so too Hezekiah was righteous, but Ahaz, his father was an evildoer; Josiah was righteous, but Amon, his father, was an evildoer. Is this proper, that the righteous be struck for the iniquities of their parents?\" The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, \"Behold, you have taught Me! By your life, I will nullify My words and preserve your words, as it is stated (Deut. 24:15), ‘The parents shall not die for the children, and the children shall not die for the parents'; and it is by your life that I shall write [these things] in your name, as it is stated (II Kings 14:6), 'as it is written in the Torah of Moses, which God commanded ....'\" The third one is when the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, \"Make war on Sichon; even if he does not want to engage with you, wage war with him, as stated (Deut. 2:24), 'Get up, go and cross the Arnon .'\" But Moses did not do like this. Rather what is written above? \"And I sent messengers\" (Deut. 2:26). The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, \"By your life, I will nullify My words and preserve your words, as it is stated (Deut. 20:11), 'When you approach a town to attack it, you shall offer it terms of peace.'\" Once Sichon did not accept, the Holy One, blessed be He, felled him in front of them, as it is stated (Deut. 20:33), \"and we smote him.\" And not only that, but even [with] those that were hiding themselves in the caves to kill [the Israelites], the Holy One, blessed be He, signaled to the mountain and it crushed them, as it is stated (Ps. 74:13-14), \"who smashed the heads of the monsters in the waters. It was You who crushed the heads of Leviathan.\" A common proverb says [that] if you gave bread to an infant, let his mother know. The Holy One, blessed be He, said, \"From where will Israel know the favor I did for them?\" What did He do? He distanced the mountains from each other and the streams swept down [the corpses], as it is stated (Numb 21:17), \"And the streams poured.\" And the Israelites passed by and sang song - \"then Israel sang\" (Numb. 21:17). Israel said, \"It is for You to do miracles for us, but it is for us to bless and laud Your name\" - \"Salvation is to the Lord; upon Your people is Your blessing, Selah\" (Ps. 3:9). Upon the waters was it decreed against Moses, so he was not mentioned in the song. Moses said, \"Master of the Universe, \"I am dying because of them. You gave them the Torah from the wilderness, as it is stated, (Numb. 21:18), 'and from the wilderness, Matanah (which is also the word for gift).' And they possessed (<i>nachalu</i>) it from my hands, as it is stated (Numb. 21:19), 'And from Matanah, Nachliel.'\" And from when they possessed it, You decreed death upon me, as it is stated (Numb. 21:19), \"and from Nachliel, Bamot\" - and from possession comes death (<i>menachal, ba mot</i>). \"And from Bamot, Haggai in the field of Moav\" (Numb. 21:20), as it is stated (Deut. 34:6), \"And He buried him in the valley in the land of Moav.\" Job said, \"He is not partial to princes; the noble are not preferred to the wretched; for all of them are the work of His hands\" (Job 34:19)."

            "8": "9 This is [the meaning of] that which is stated (Proverbs 18:18), \"The lot puts an end to strife.\" Since a sign was written for each and every tribe from Yaakov - \"Zevulun will dwell on the shore of the seas\" (Genesis 49:13); \"Yissachar is a boney donkey, etc.\" (Genesis 49:14); \"From Asher, his bread is fat\" (Genesis 49:20) – you are only permitted to divide [the land] by the lot. And there were miraculous acts in the lottery: Elazar the Priest wears the <i>Urim and Tumim</i>. And the slips of the lottery were in front of Yehoshua, as stated (Joshua 18:6) \"And I will cast the lot for you here in front of the Lord.\" But before the lot went up, Elazar said with the holy spirit, “The lot of tribe x is coming up, to take place y.” And Yehoshua would extend his hand and [it] would come up [into his hand. It was] as it is stated (Joshua 19:51), \"These are the inheritances that Elazar the Priest and Yehoshua ben Nun apportioned.\" And this was [even] more; that the lot would yell out at the time that it went up, \"I am the lot of tribe x; I have gone up to it in place y.\" And from where [do we know] that the lot speaks? As it is stated (Numbers 26:56), \"By the mouth of (according to) the lot.\"",

In your days, have you heard one saying, ‘Water this vine with wine, so that it will produce much wine,’ [or] ‘Water this olive tree with oil, so that it will produce much oil.’ My creatures do not need My creatures and I should need My creatures?” R. Jannai said, “It is customary that when a man is walking by a river, it is impossible for him not to drink two or three <i>log</i>. Now all the seas and all the water would fill the hollow of My hand, as stated (in Is. 40:12), ‘Who has measured the waters in the hollow of His hand?’ But [yet] I have written about your <i>log</i> (in Numb. 28:7), ‘poured as an offering of fermented drink,’ [which is] an expression of drinking, an expression of satiation, an expression of inebriation.” ",
            "18": "19 I have created one animal in My world, and man is not able to support its victuals. And which is it? That is (in Ps. 50:10), “the behemoths on a thousand mountains.” R. Johanan, R. Simeon ben Laqish and the sages [disagreed about this]. R. Johanan said, “It was one animal crouching on a thousand mountains and a thousand mountains would produce many types of food, for the righteous to eat in the future to come, as stated (in Is. 65:10), ‘Sharon shall become a pasture for flocks, and the Valley of Achor a place for cattle to lie down.’” And the Sages say, “It crouches upon the thousand mountains, and the thousand mountains produce animals every day and it eats [them].” What is the explanation? [As] (in Job 40:20, cont.), “and all the beasts of the field play there.” Is it possible for a grazing animal to eat a grazing animal? R. Tanchuma says, “Great is the work of our God and how great are His acts.” And from where does it drink? R. Joshua ben Levi says, “It drinks up with one swallow all that the Jordan produces in six months, as stated (in Job 40:23), ‘He can restrain the river from its rushing; he is confident the Jordan will gush at his command.’ And the sages say, “It drinks up with one swallow all that the Jordan produces in twelve months, as stated (in Job 40:23), ‘He can restrain the river from its rushing; he is confident the Jordan will gush at his command.’ But it only has a moistening of the mouth [from it].” R. Huna said in the name of R. Joseph, “It did not [even] have a moistening of the mouth.” And [so] from where does it drink? R. Simeon ben Yochai taught (form Gen. 2:10), “’A river issues from Eden to water the garden’ and its name is Yuval, as stated (in Jer. 17:8), ‘sending forth its roots by a stream (<i>yuval</i>),’ and it drinks from it.” R. Chiya taught in the name of R. Meir (from Job 12:7), “’But ask the beasts, and they will teach you; the birds of the sky, they will tell you’: ’But ask the beasts,’ this is the behemoth; ‘the birds of the sky,’ this is the <i>ziz</i> of the Omnipresent (a giant bird). [(Job 12:8) ‘Or speak to the earth, it will teach you; the fish of the sea, they will inform you’:] ‘Or speak to the earth,’ this is the Garden of Eden; ‘The fish of the sea,’ that is the leviathan. (Job 12:9) ‘Who among all these does not know that the hand of the Lord has done this?’” ",
            "19": "20 You have one king and his name was Solomon, as stated (about the lavishness of his meals in I Kings 5:2-3), “Solomon’s daily provisions consisted of thirty <i>kor</i> of semolina, and sixty <i>kor</i> of [ordinary] flour, ten fattened oxen […].” R. Yehuda bar Zvidah said, “Solomon had a thousand wives and each and every one would make him like this every day, as she thought he would eat with her. [And] Nehemiah the governor did not [even] have the ability to reckon his meal, as stated (in Neh. 5:18), ‘And although what was prepared for each day came to one ox […].’ The Holy One, blessed be He, said, ‘My children, it is not because there is eating and drinking in front of Me that I said [it] to you. Rather it is because of the smell; that you shall be joyful and pleasant in front of Me, like a pleasing smell.’”",
            "20": "21 (Numb 28:2) “Guard to offer it to Me at its set time”: This text is related (to Prov. 13:25), “The righteous man eats to satiate his soul.” This is Eliezer who said to Rebekah (in Gen. 24:17), “Please let me sip a bit of water,” enough to sip. (Prov. 13:25, cont.) “But the belly of the wicked is lacking.” That is Esau who said to Jacob (in Gen. 25:30), “Please stuff me (<i>haliteini</i>).” R. Isaac bar Zeira said, “He opened his mouth wide like a camel and said, ‘I will open my mouth and you put it in.’” It is taught there (Mishnah Shabbat 24:3), “One may not forcibly overfeed a camel on Shabbat and one may not force-feed it. However, one may place food into its mouth (<i>malitin</i>).” (Prov. 13:25), “The righteous man eats to satiate his soul”: This is Ruth about whom it is written (in Ruth 2:14), “and she ate her fill and had some left over.” As blessing dwelt in the mouth of that righteous woman. (Prov. 13:25, cont.) “But the belly of the wicked is lacking”: That is the gentiles. There was a story about a gentile who made a banquet for all the people of his city: R. Dustai said, “He invited me to that banquet, with all the people of his city, and his table was not lacking any of the tasty foods of the world except for <i>perekh</i> nuts alone. What did he do? He took the serving table that was in front of us that was worth more than sixty talents of silver and he broke it. I said to him, ‘Why did you do this?’ He said to me, ‘You say that this world is ours and the next world is yours. If we do not [get to] eat now, when will we eat?’ I read [as being] about him (Prov. 13:25, cont.), ‘but the belly of the wicked is lacking.’” ",
            "22": "23 \"Command the Children of Israel\" (Numbers 28:2). This is [the meaning of] that which was stated by the verse (Job 27:23), \"The Omnipresent we have not found to be of great power\"; and [yet] it is written (in Job 36:22), \"It is true that God is beyond reach in His power.\" How are these two verses [resolved]? Rather [it is that] when He gives to [Israel], He gives to them according to His power. But when He requests something from them, He only requests according to their power. See what is written (Exodus 26:1), \"As for the Tabernacle, make it of ten curtains.\" But in the future, the Holy One, blessed be He, will make a canopy from clouds of glory for each and every righteous person, as it is stated (in Is. 4:5), \"The Lord will create over the whole shrine and meeting place of Mount Zion cloud by day and smoke with a glow of flaming fire by night; indeed over all the glory shall hang a canopy.\" And why is smoke in the canopy? Since anyone whose eyes were smoky and stingy with his students in this world will have his canopy filled with smoke in the world to come. Why is there fire in the canopy? [It is coming to] teach that each and every righteous person is lit up from the canopy of his fellow, that is more elevated than he; with light the radiance of which shines from [one] end of the world to the [other] end. Hence it is written, \"It is true that God is beyond reach in His power.\" When He requested something from them, He only requested according to their power, as it is stated (Exodus 27:20), \"And you shall command [...].\" But when He lit up for them, it was according to His power, as it is stated (Exodus 13:21), \"And the Lord went in front of them by day.\" [Moreover, about] the future to come, it is stated (Isaiah 60:1-3), \"Arise, My light [...]. But upon you the Lord will shine, and His Presence be seen over you. And nations shall walk by your light; kings, by your shining radiance. And it is written, (Isaiah 30:26), \"And the light of the moon shall become like the light of the sun […].\" Hence, \"It is true that God is beyond reach in His power.\" When He requested something from them, He only requested according to their power, as it is stated (Exodus 23:19), \"The choice first fruits of your land.\" But when He gives to them, it is according to His power, as it is stated (Ezekiel 47:12), \"All kinds of trees for food will grow up on both banks of the stream; their leaves will not wither nor their fruit fail; they will yield new fruit every month.\" What is [the meaning of] \"they will yield new fruit every month?\" That each and every tree yields new fruit each and every month, [such that] the new fruit of this month is not like the new fruit of another month. When He requested something from them, He only requested according to their power, as it is stated (Leviticus 23:40), \"And you shall take for yourselves on the first day the fruit of a beautiful true.\" But when He gives, it is according to His power, as it is stated (Isaiah 41:19), \"I will give in the wilderness cedar, acacia […].\" [And it is also written] (Isaiah 55:13), \"Instead of the brier, a cypress shall rise.\" ",
            "23": "24 (Numb. 29:35) “On the eighth day you shall have a solemn assembly”: This text is related (to Is. 26:16), “You have added to the nation O Lord.\" The Community of Israel said in front of the Holy One, blessed be He, “Master of the world, You added [years of] tranquility to the generation of the flood, did they maybe ever offer a single bull or a single ram? It is not enough that they did not offer, but they [even] said (in Gen. 11:4), ‘Let us build for ourselves a city.’ And so too with the Sodomites, and so too with Pharaoh, and so too with Sennacherib and so too with Nebuchadnezzar. Did they maybe ever offer a single bull or a single ram? It is not enough that they did not offer [anything] in front of You, but they even angered You. And to whom is it fitting for You to add tranquility and glory? To Israel, as stated (in Is. 26:16), ‘You have added to the nation.’” And a nation is only referring to Israel, as stated (in II Sam. 7:23), “And who is like Your people Israel, a unique nation on earth.” The community of Israel said in front of the Holy One, blessed be He, “Master of the world, You should add festivals for us, and we shall offer sacrifices in front of You as is fitting.” (Is. 26:16, cont.) “You have been honored,” “You have given us new moons, and we sacrifice in front of You [then], as is stated (in Numb. 28:11), ‘And on new moons.’ You have given us Passover, we have sacrificed to You; You have given us Pentecost, we have sacrificed to You; You have given us the New Year, we have sacrificed to You; You have given us the Day of Atonement, we have sacrificed to You. And so too on the Festival [of Tabernacles]. We have not ignored [the sacrifices for] even one festival.” The Community of Israel said, “You should add festivals for us, and we shall offer sacrifices in front of You and honor You.” (Is. 26:16, cont.) “You have added to the nation and been honored […].” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel, “By your lives, I will not take away holidays [from you], but I will add festivals for you to rejoice in them, as stated (in Numb. 29:35), ‘On the eighth day you shall have a solemn assembly.’” "

            "0": "A Halakha: <u>Is one who is pursued by non-Jews or bandits allowed to transgress the laws of Sabbath?</u> Our Rabbis taught: One who is pursued by non-Jews or bandits is permitted to transgress the laws of Sabbath, in order to save his life. Thus we also find with David: When Saul attempted to kill him, he fled and escaped. Our Rabbis said: It once happened that they came to the [Jewish] leadership in Sepphoris with harsh orders from the [Roman] government. They went and said to R. Elazar b. Parta: O Rabbi! We have received harsh orders from the government. What do you say we should do, should we flee? He feared telling them to flee explicitly, so he hinted to them: \"Why are you asking me? Go and ask Yaakov, Moshe, and David\". What does it say about Yaakov? (Hosea 12): \"And Jacob fled.\" Also about Moshe, (Exodus 2): \"Moshe fled.\" And also about David, (I Samuel 19): \"David fled and escaped.\" It also says (Isaiah 26): \"Go my people, enter your rooms.\" The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to them: Such great ones were fearful and fled from those who hated them, yet for those forty years that you were in the desert, I did not let them flee. Instead I felled all their haters before them, in that I myself that was with them. Not only that, but there were all kinds of snakes, serafim, and scorpions there: (Deuteronomy 8): \"Snakes, sefarim, and scorpions\", yet I did not allow them to hurt you. Therefore The Holy One Blessed Be He said to Moshe: Record the journeys that Israel undertook in the desert, it order that they should know what kind of miracles I performed from them. How [will they know]? From all that they read regarding \"These are the journeys\".",
            "1": "2 This is what is stated in the verse (Psalms 77:21), \"You led (<i>nachita</i>) Your people like a flock through Moshe and Aharon.\" What is [the meaning of] <i>nachita</i>? It is the expression of an acrostic: Rabbi Eliezer says, \"You did <i>Nissim</i> (miracles) for them; You gave them <i>Chaim</i> (life); You split the <i>Yam Suf</i> (Reed Sea) for them; You gave them the <i>Torah</i> through Moshe and Aharon.\" Rabbi Yehoshua says, \"You did <i>Niflaot</i> (wonders) for them; You gave them <i>Cherut</i> (freedom); <i>Yamincha</i> (Your right hand) delivered them; You gave them <i>Tilluy rosh</i> (holding the head high) through Moshe and Aharon.\" Our masters said, \"<i>Nevi'im</i> (prophets) did You raise up from them; <i>Hasidim</i> (saints) did You raise up from them; <i>Yesharim</i> (upright ones) did You raise up from them; <i>Temimim</i> (unblemished ones) did You raise up from them through Moses and Aharon.\" Another interpretation [of] <i>nachita</i>: Rabbi Akiva says, \"You did <i>Noraot</i> (dreadful things) to their enemies; You sent<i>Charon af</i> (waxing anger) against them and You fought against them; You covered them with <i>Tehomot</i> (depths) through Moshe and Aharon. Another interpretation of (Psalms 77:21), \"You led Your people like a flock\": What is [the meaning of] flock? Just like one does not bring a flock under the shade of a roof (indoors), so too Israel when they were in the wilderness were not brought under the shade of a roof for forty years. Hence they were compared to a flock. Another interpretation of  (Psalms 77:21), \"You led Your people like a flock\": Just like a flock does not have storerooms collected for them but rather only graze from the wilderness, so too Israel for the forty years that they were in the wilderness were fed without storehouses. . Hence they were compared to a flock. Another interpretation of (Psalms 77:21), \"You led Your people like a flock\": And just like a flock follows to anywhere that the shepherd leads them, so too Israel journeyed to any place that Moshe and Aharon took them, as it is stated, \"These are the journeys of the Children of Israel\" - in order to fulfill that which is stated, \"You led Your people like a flock through Moshe and Aharon.\"",
            "2": "3 (Numbers 33:1) \"These are the stages of the Children of Israel\": [The matter] is comparable to a king whose son was ill. He brought him to a certain place to heal him. When they returned, his father began recounting the stages, “Here we slept. Here we cooled off. Here you had a headache.” Similarly the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moshe, \"Recount to them all the places where they provoked Me.\" It is therefore stated (in Numbers 33:1), \"These are the stages....\" ",
            "3": "4 Another interpretation: Why did all these stages (places) merit to be written in the Torah? Since they received (accommodated) Israel, the Holy One, blessed be He, will give them their reward in the future. It is so stated (in Isaiah 35:1-2), \"The arid desert shall be glad.... It shall blossom abundantly, it shall also exult....\" And if the desert [will receive] such for receiving Israel; one who receives a Torah scholar into his home, all the more so [will he be rewarded]. You find that in the future the desert will be a settlement and a settlement will be a desert. And where is it shown a settlement will be a desert in the future? It is so stated (Malachi 1:3), \"And I have hated Esav and will make his hills a desolation.\" And where is it shown a desert will be a settlement in the future? It is so stated (Isaiah 41:8), \"I will make a desert into a lake of water.\" Now there are no trees in the desert, but there will be trees there in the future, as stated (Isaiah  41:19), \"I will put cedar and acacia in the desert....\" Now there is no path there, as it is all sand. But there will be a path there in the future, as stated (Isaiah 43:19), \"I will place a path in the desert […].\" And it states (Isaiah 35:8), \"And there will be a highway there, and it shall be called the Sacred Way [...].\"",
            "7": "8 (Numbers 34:2) When you come to the Land of Israel: This is what is stated in the verse (in Numbers 23:19), \"God is not a man to be deceitful,\" [meaning] a man will not make God deceitful; \"nor the son of\" Amram (this is a play on words, as the verse reads, the son of man, \"Adam\") to make Him \"change His mind.\" As [only after God] said, \"Let Me go and I will destroy them,\" did the son of Amram stand and make Him change His mind, as stated (Exodus 32:14), \"And the Lord rescinded the evil that He was saying to do to His people.\" Another interpretation (of Numbers 23:19): \"God is not a man to be deceitful,\" with the good. When He speaks to bring good – even if the generation is liable – He does not delay [it]. But when He speaks to bring evil, He does go back on it, as it is stated (Numbers 23:19), \"He said it but does not do [it].\" You should know that He said to Avraham (Genesis 15:5), \"Look toward heaven and count the stars [...].\" And He did it, as stated (Deuteronomy 1:10), \"The Lord, your God, multiplied you, and behold you are today....\" [But when] He said to Avraham (Genesis 15:13), \"Know well that your offspring shall be strangers [... four hundred years],\" they only did two hundred and ten years. That is [the meaning of], \"God is not a man to be deceitful\" – with the good. But with the evil, \"He said it but does not do [it].\" [In this vein,] He said to Israel, \"As you are not My people\" (Hosea 1:9). But He went back and said, \"And I will say to Not My People, 'You are My people'\" (Hosea 2: 25). That is [the meaning of], \"He said it but does not do [it].\" He said to Avraham, \"As I will give [the land] to you and your offspring\" (Genesis 26:3), and He did not go back [on it]. As it is stated (Numbers 34:2), \"when you come to the Land of Canaan,\" and He brought them into the Land.",
            "11": "This is as the verse says (Psalms 111:6) \"He revealed the strength of His deeds to His people, [in giving them the heritage of nations]\". The Holy Blessed One said to Israel, \"I could have created for you a new land; but, for the sake of showing you My strength, I will kill your enemies before you and give you their land; in order to fulfill what is written, \"He revealed the strength of His deeds to His people, in giving them the heritage of nations\" (ibid).",
            "12": "\"And you shall provide yourselves with cities\" (Numbers 35:11), this is what the verse says, \"Good and upright is the Lord, therefore He shows sinners the way.\" (Psalms 25:8) \"Remember Your mercy, O God, and your lovingkindness.\" (Psalms 25:6). David said, Master of the Universe, were it not for the fact that Your lovingkindness preceded the First Man, he would not have been able to stand, as it says \"For the day you eat of it [the tree of knowledge of good and evil] you will surely die\" (Genesis 2:17). And You did not do this; rather, You brought him out from the Garden of Eden and he lived for 930 years(!) and only after that did he die. Why did you do that to him, to drive him out from the Garden of Eden, as it says (Genesis 3:24)  \"and He drove out the man\"? Why was he driven out, since he brought death upon the generations, and he was sentenced to immediate death? Rather, You had mercy upon him and drove him off, just as the accidental killer is exiled to a city of refuge. Thus it says, \"Remember Your mercy, O God, and Your lovingkindness, etc.\" Once Moshe stood and the Holy Blessed One told him, \"Provide yourselves with cities...\", Moshe said \"Master of the Universe, this one killed by accident in the south or the north; how will he know where the city of refuge is, that he may flee to it?\" God replied, \"'Set for yourselves the path... [i.e. to the cities of refuge]' (Deuteronomy 19:3), orient for yourselves the path so that you will not be mistaken and find the blood avenger and he will kill you \"and there will be for him no death penalty\" (Deuteronomy 19:6).\" He [Moshe] said again, \"How?\" He [God] said to him, set up for yourselves signs [<i>istlayot</i>] pointing to the cities of refuge, that they will know where to travel. And on every sign write \"Killer to the city of refuge\", as it says \"prepare for yourselves the way\". Thus said David, \"Good and upright is the Lord, therefore He shows sinners the way.\" If for killers He makes a path and a road for them to flee by and be saved, all the more so for righteous! \"He guides the humble in justice, and teaches the humble His way\" (Psalms 25:9). \"And the killer shall flee there who has killed a soul by accident\" -- but not on purpose. If he kills on purpose and he says \"I accidentally killed\" and flees to the cities of refuge, the Holy Blessed One says, even if he flees and enters to My altar, you shall kill him, as it says (Exodus 21:14) \"And if a person schemes, etc [against another, and kills him treacherously, you shall take him from My very altar to be put to death]\". And who was it who fled to the altar and was killed? Yoav, as it says (I Kings 2:28) \"When the news reached Joab, he fled to the Tent of the LORD [and grasped the horns of the altar]...\". And it says (II Samuel 23:8) \"Tahchemonite, the chief officer\" -- he did not know that it is written in the Torah \"And if a person schemes, etc\" that he went and grasped the horns of the altar. Rather it says \"Those killed by the court are not buried in the graves of their fathers, rather they alone; it is better for me that I die here and be buried in the graves of my fathers\". (I Kings 3:30-31) \"Benaiah reported back to the king that Joab had answered thus and thus, and the king said, 'Do just as he said; strike him down and bury him, and remove guilt from me and my father’s house for the blood of the innocent that Joab has shed.'\" And why was he killed? For so David his [Shlomo's] father had commanded him -- \"Further, you know what Joab son of Zeruiah did to me, what he did to the two commanders of Israel’s forces, Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of Jether: he killed them\" (I Kings 2:5). What did he do to him..."
