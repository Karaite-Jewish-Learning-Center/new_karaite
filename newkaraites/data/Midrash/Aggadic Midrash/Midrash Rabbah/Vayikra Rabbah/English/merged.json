They will become primary, just as Israel as it says “…Corn [will give strength to] young men, and new wine will cause maids to speak.” (Zechariah 9:17) “…and blossom like the vine…” (Hoshea 14:8) As it says “You uprooted a vine from Egypt; You drove out nations and planted it.” (Tehillim 80:9)’ Another explanation. “…they shall revive [like] corn…” (Hoshea 14:8) in their Talmudic learning, “…and blossom like the vine…” (ibid.) in their aggadic learning. “; it (fragrance) will recall the wine of Lebanon.” (ibid.) The Holy One said ‘the names of converts are beloved to Me like idolatrous wine which was offered before Me on the altar.’ And why is its name Lebanon? Because of the verse “…this good mountain and the Lebanon.” (Devarim 3:25) R’ Shimon bar Yochai taught: why is it called Lebanon, because it bleaches out (malbin) the sins of Israel like snow, as it says “…If your sins prove to be like crimson, they will become white as snow; if they prove to be as red as crimson dye, they shall become as wool.” (Yeshayahu 1:18) R’ Teviyumi said ‘because all hearts (levavot) rejoice in it, as it says “The fairest of branches, the joy of the entire earth- Mount Zion…” (Tehillim 48:3) The Rabbis say ‘because “…and My eyes and My heart (libi) shall be there at all times.” (Melachim I 9:3)",

Parshas Mishkan [the building of the Tabernacle]. This can be compared to a King who commanded his servant and said to him, \"Build me a palace.\" On every item which the servant built he wrote the name of the King on it. When he built walls he wrote the name of the King on them. When he stood up columns he wrote the name of the King on them. When he installed beams he wrote the name of the King on them. After a while, the King entered into the palace. On everything which he looked, he found his name written. He said, \"All this great honor was afforded to me by my servant and I am on the interior and he is outside?!\" [The King] called [the servant] to enter into the inner part of the palace. So too, when The Holy One, Blessed is He, said to Moses, \"Build me a Sanctuary,\" on every single mater Moses wrote, \"As Hashem had commanded Moses.\" The Holy One said, \"All of this great honor was given to me by Moses and I'm inside and he is outside?!\" He (G-d) called to him (Moses) to enter the inner place, and therefore it says, \"And He called to Moses.\"  "

            "4": "\"Speak to the children of Israel, saying, 'A person who has transgressed...'.\" Rabbi Ishmael taught a parable [or \"made a comparison\"] to a king who had an orchard and in it had lovely first fruits. The king placed upon it guards, one lame and one blind. He said to them: 'Take care of these lovely first fruits.' After some days, the lame one said to the blind one, 'I see lovely first fruits in the orchard.' The blind one said to him, 'Bring them, and we will eat!' The lame one said to the blind one, '[I would] were I able to walk!' The blind one said, '[I would] were I able to see!' The lame one rode upon the back of the blind one, and they ate the first fruits, and they went and returned each man in his own place. After some days, the king entered that orchard. He said to them, 'Where are the beautiful first fruits?' The blind one said to him, 'My lord king, [I would] were I able to see!' The lame one said to him, '[I would] were I able to walk!' That king understood what they had done. He placed the the lame one on the back of the blind one and they began to walk.\" Thus, in the future, the Holy Blessing One will say to the soul, \"Why did you transgress before Me?\" It will say to him, \"Master of the Universe! I did not sin. The body is the one who sinned! From the moment I left it I have been like a pure bird bursting into the air. How have I transgressed before You?\" God will say to the body, \"Why have you transgressed before Me?\" The body will say to him, Master of the Universe! I did not sin. The soul is the one who sinned! From the moment that she left me, I have been tossed like a rock is thrown onto the ground. How would I have transgressed before you?!\" What does the Holy Blessing One do to them? God brings the soul and throws it into the body and judges them together, as it is said, \"He will call to the heavens above...\" (Psalms 50: 4). God will call to the heavens above to bring the soul and to the earth to bring the body, and judge them together.

Just as a sheep, when hurt on its head or some other body part, all of its body parts feel it. So it is with Israel when one of them sins and everyone feels it. (Numbers 16:22): \"When one man sins [will You be wrathful with the whole community].\" Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai taught a parable: Men were on a ship. One of them took a drill and started drilling underneath him. The others said to him: What are sitting and doing?! He replied: What do you care. Is this not underneath my area that I am drilling?! They said to him: But the water will rise and flood us all on this ship. This is as Iyob said (Job 19:4): \"If indeed I have erred, my error remains with me.\" But his friends said to him (Job 34:37): \"He adds transgression to his sin; he extends it among us.\" [The men on the ship said]: You extend your sins among us. Rabbi Elasa said: a gentile asked Rabbi Yehoshua ben Karha: In your Torah, it is written (Exodus 23:2): \"After the multitude will you side.\" We are more numerous than you, so why don't you become like us in practicing idolatry? He [Rabbi Yehoshua ben Karha] said to him: Do you have children? He replied: You reminded me of my troubles. He asked: Why? [The gentile] said: I have many children. When they sit at my table, this one blesses to this god and that one blesses to that god, and they don't get up from the table until they wrack each other's brains. He [Rabbi Yehoshua ben Karha] said: Do you settle [the arguments] with them? He said: No. He [Rabbi Yehoshua ben Karha] said: Before you make us agree with you, find agreement with your own children! [The gentile] was spurned and went away. After he left [Rabbi Yehoshua ben Karha's] students said to him: Rabbi! You pushed him away like a broken reed, but what would you answer for us? He said to them: Six souls are about written [in the Torah] about Esau, and \"souls\" [nefashot] is written in the plural, as stated (Genesis 36:6): \"Esau took his wives, his sons and daughters, and all the souls of his household.\" For Yaakov, however, there were seventy souls, and soul [nefesh] is written [in the Torah] in the singular. As it is stated (Exodus 1:5): \"And all of the people [nefesh] that were of Jacob's issue, etc.\" Because Esau worshipped many gods, it is written many \"souls,\" but for Yaakov--who worshipped one God--it is written one soul, \"And all of the people [nefesh], etc.\"",

Rabbi Yannai said to him: Would you like to come over to my house? The man replied: Yes. Rabbi Yannai brought him into his home, and gave him food and drink. As they were eating and drinking together, he examined him in his knowledge of Bible, and found out that he had none; examined his knowledge of Mishnah, and realized that he had none; his knowledge of legends, and saw that he had none; his knowledge of Talmud and saw he had none. Rabbi Yannai then told him: Wash and recite grace. Said the guest: Let Yannai recite grace in his own home. Seeing that he could not even recite a blessing, Yannai told him: Can you at least repeat what I say? Said he: Yes. Said Rabbi Yannai: repeat the following: 'A dog has eaten Yannai's bread.' Offended, the man stood up, and grabbed Rabbi Yannai by the coat! He then said: My inheritance is with you, and you are withholding it from me! Said Rabbi Yannai with puzzlement: What legacy of yours is there with me? He replied: Once I passed by a school, and I heard the voices of the little children saying: 'Moses gave us the Torah, the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob.' They did not say 'the inheritance of the congregation of Yannai,' but the 'congregation of Jacob.' Rabbi Yannai asked, “How then are you worthy to eat at my table?” The guest replied, “Never have I heard an evil word spoken against me and returned to argue with the person who spoke it. Never have I seen two people arguing without making peace between them.” Rabbi Yannai then said, “you have so much Derech Eretz and I called you a dog.” On him rabbi Yanai said the verse “And there is a path” – meaning not one, but two paths take you to salvation – since rabbi Ishmael son of rav Nachman said: Derech eretz precedes Torah by 26 generations, since it is written “and to guard the way to the Tree of Life” (Genesis 3). “Way” is the derech eretz, and only after that comes “Tree of Life” which is Torah. [Back to the verse in question, Ps 50:23] I will show him the salvation of God, said rabbi Abahu: this is one of the sources for the idea that God’s salvation is Israel’s salvation (Ps. 80:3) “and come and save us”",
            "7": "Rabbi Pinchas, Rabbi Levi and Rabbi Yochanan [said] in the name of Rabbi Menachem from Gallia: In the time to come, all sacrifices will be annulled - but the sacrifice of thanksgiving will not be annulled.  All prayers will be annulled, but the prayer of gratitude will not be annulled.  This accords with what is written [Jeremiah 33:11]: \"The voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the groom and the voice of the bride, the voice of those who say 'Give thanks to the LORD of hosts' etc.\" - this is the prayer of gratitude.  \"Those who bring [the sacrifice of] thanksgiving to the House of the LORD\": this is the sacrifice of thanksgiving.  Thus David said: \"I owe You vows and will offer you thanksgivings\" [Psalms 56:13] - not \"thanksgiving,\" but \"thanksgivings,\" [indicating both] the thanksgiving prayer and the prayer of gratitude.",
            "8": "Said Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: Great is peace, for all blessings are included with it, \"Adonai grants strength to His people, Adonai blesses his people with peace\" (Psalm 29:11). Ḥizkiyah said two things. Ḥizkiyah said: Great is peace, for all the commandments are written this way: \"When you see\" (Exodus 23:5), \"when you encounter\" (Exodus 23:4), \"when you come across\" (Deuteronomy 22:6). If a commandment comes to you you are bound to do it, but if not you are not bound to do it. But here it says \"Seek peace and pursue it\" (Psalm 34:15) – seek it for your place, and pursue it for other places. Ḥizkiyah said also: Great is peace, for of all the encampments it is written thus (Numbers 33) \"And they set out... and they encamped\" – they would set out divided and would encamp divided. When they all came before Mt. Sinai it was done as one encampment, as it is written (Exodus 19:2) \"And Israel encamped there\"—it isn't written \"And the Israelites encamped there\" in the plural, but \"and Israel encamped there\" in the singular!—Because of this the Holy Blessed One said, \"Here is the gate where I will give the Torah to My children.\" Bar Kappara said three things. Bar Kappara said: Great is peace, for the scriptures use words of fiction in the Torah so as to impose peace between Abraham and Sarah, as it is written \"After I am withered shall I have pleasure? And my husband is so old!\" (Genesis 18:12) But to Abraham He didn't say that but rather \"And I am so old!\" (Genesis 18:13). Bar Kappara also said: Great is peace, for the scriptures use words of fiction in the Prophetic books to impose peace between husband and wife, as it is said, \"Look, you are barren and have borne no children, but you will conceive and bear a son\" (Judges 13:3), but to Manoaḥ He didn't say that but rather \"All that I said to the woman she should follow\" (Judges 13:13) – in all that she still needs markers. Bar Kappara also said: Great is peace, for if the celestials who have no jealousy or hatred or rivalry or strife or quarrels or debates or evil eye require peace, as it is written (Job 25:2) \"He who makes peace in the heavens,\" how much more so the mortals who have all those traits? Said Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel: Great is peace, because the writings spoke works of fiction in the Torah to impose peace between Joseph and his brothers, as it is written (Genesis 50:17) “Thus say to Yosef, please forgive” - but we do not find Jacob commanding any such thing! Said Rabbi Yosei the Galilean: Great is pace, for even in a time of war we only open with peace, as it is written (Deuteronomy 20:10) \"When you approach a city to make war on it, call out to it for peace.\" Said Rabbi Yudan son of Rabbi Yosei: Great is peace, for the name of the Holy Blessed One is called peace, as it is written \"And he called it \"Adonai is peace\" (Judges 6:24). Said Rabbi Tanḥum son of Yudan, from here we derive that it is forbidden for one to call out \"Peace\" to a companion in a filthy place. Taught Rabbi Yishmael: Great is peace, for even the Great Name written in holiness, the Holy Blessed One said to blot out in water so as to impose peace between husband and wife. (See Numbers 5:19-23). Rabbi Meir was sitting and discoursing on Shabbat evening. There was this one woman who would sit and listen to him give his lecture. Once she waited until the lecture ended, went home, and found the light had gone out. Her husband said to her, \"Where have you been?\" She said to him, \"I was sitting and listening to the voice of the lecturer.\" He said to her, \"Thus and more I vow: I will not let you enter here until you go and spit in the lecturer's face!\" She stayed away one Shabbat, another, a third. Her neighbors said to her, \"Are you still angry at each other? Let's come with you to the lecture.\" When Rabbi Meir saw them, he figured it out through the holy spirit. He said to them, \"Is there here a woman knowledgeable in treating eyes?\" Her neighbors said to her, \"If you go spit in his eye you will unbind your husband.\" When she sat down in front of  him she became afraid of him, and said to him, \"Rabbi, I am not knowledgeable in treating eyes.\" He said to her, \"Even so, spit in my eye seven times, and I will be cured.\" She did so. He said to her, \"Go tell your husband you told me to do it once and I spat seven times. His disciples said to him, \"Rabbi, should people thus abuse the Torah? Couldn't one of us offered a treatment for you?\" He said to them, \"Is it not enough for Meir to be like his Maker?\" For it had been taught: Great is peace, for even the Great Name written in holiness, the Holy Blessed One said to blot out in water so as to impose peace between husband and wife.\"  Said Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta: Great is peace, for when the Holy Blessed One created His universe He made pace between the upper and lower parts. On the first day He created some of the upper and lower parts, as it is written \"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth\" (Genesis 1:1). On the second He created some of the upper parts, as it is written \"And God said, 'let there be a firmament'\" (Genesis 1:6). On the third He created some of the lower parts, as it is written, \"And God said, 'gather the waters'\" (Genesis 1:9). On the fourth some of the upper parts — \"Let there be lights in the heavenly firmament\" (Genesis 1:14). On the fifth He created some of the lower parts — \"And God said, 'Let the waters swarm'\" (Genesis 1:20). On the sixth He came to create humanity. He said, \"If I create him from more upper parts, then the upper parts will outnumber the lower by one creation. If I create him from more lower parts, then the lower parts will outnumber the upper by one creation.\" What did He do? He made him from upper parts and from lower parts, as it is written \"And Adonai God created humanity from the dust of the earth\" (Genesis 2:7) — lower parts, \"and blew into his nostrils the breath of life (Genesis 2:7) — upper parts. Rabbi Manei of Sh'av and Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin said in the name of Rabbi Levi: Great is peace for all blessings and goodnesses and mercies that the Holy Blessed One gives to Israel are sealed with peace. The reading of the Shema — \"spreads the shelter of peace.\" The standing prayer — \"He who makes peace.\" The Priestly Blessing — \"and grant you peace\" (Numbers 6:26). And I only know this regarding blessings, so where do we derive this for sacrifices? \"This is the Torah of the burnt-offering, of the grain-offering, and of the sin-offering, and of the guilt-offering, and of the fulfillment-offerings, and of the peace-offering\" (Leviticus 7:37). I only know this in general, so where do we derive this in detail? \"This is the Torah of the burnt-offering\" (Leviticus 6:2), \"This is the Torah of the grain-offering\" (Leviticus 6:7), \"This is the Torah of the sin-offering\" (Leviticus 6:18), \"This is the Torah of the guilt-offering\" (Leviticus 7:1), \"This is the Torah of the peace-offering\" (Leviticus 7:11).  I only know this for individual sacrifices, so where do we derive this for communal sacrifices? The verse (Numbers 29:39) says, \"Do these for Adonai on your set times,\" but finishes with \"your peace-offerings.\" I only know this in this world, so from where do we derive this in the next? \"I will extend to her peace like a wadi\" (Isaiah 66:12).  The Rabbis said, great is peace for when the messianic king will come he will only open with peace, as it is written, \"How pleasant on the mountains are the feet of the messenger proclaiming peace!\" (Isaiah 52:7)"

            "2": "Rabbi Berachiyah said in the name of Rabbi Abbah Bar Kahana expounding on the verse about Aaron. At the time when the Israelites were about to commit the act [make the golden calf] they first came to Chur, and they said to him: \"Make us a god!\" Since he did not listen to them, they rose up and slew him. This is why it's later written in the prophets: \"Also in your wings we find the blood of the souls of the innocent and the poor etc.\" This refers to the blood of Chur. . . . \" Afterwards, they went to Aaron and said to him: \"Make us a god.\" Aaaron had heard about what they did to Chur, and became afraid. It is therefore written: \"Aaron was frightened and built an alter before them.\" Aaron was frightened that he might be the one who was going to be slaughtered. Aaron said, what should I do? They've already killed Chur, and he was was a prophet. Now if they kill me, the priest, they will fulfill the word later written in scripture: \"Should priest and prophet be slain in the sanctuary of YHWH (Eicha 2:20).\" If they kill me, they will all be exiled. Here is another interpretation (Davar Acher): Aaron saw this, and built an altar before it (Exodus 32:5). What did he see? He saw the situation playing out like this: If they build it, one will bring a pebble, another a larger stone, and they will finish the building of the idol in one day. If I build it, then I can delay and dally, and give time for our teacher Moses to come down the mountain and then destroy this idol worship. And if I build it, I can dedicate it to the name of the Holy one Blessed be God, therefore it is written: \"Aaron called and said this shall be a festival for YHWH.\" It is not written a feast for the calf, but a feast to YHWH. Another interpretation: \"And Aaron saw this, etc.\" What did he see? He saw the situation playing out as follows: \"If they build it the sin will be upon them, but if it will be better if I build it, so that the sin should be upon me and not the people. Rabbi Abba Bar Yodan said in the name of Abbah, we can give a parable that demonstrates this. It's like the son of a king who became filled with pride in his heart and took a sword and rose up to try and cut his father. The son's tutor said to him: Don't trouble yourself, leave it to me and i'll do cut him for you.\" The king saw the tutor and said to him: \"I know what your intention was, it was that you believed it better that the sin should be upon you than upon my son. As you live, you shall not leave my palace, and that which remains over from my table, you shall eat it, and you will receive twenty four perks. So too with Aaron: \"You shall not leave my palace\" is compared to \"He shall not go out of the sanctuary Leviticus 21:12\"And that which remains of the table, you shall eat it\" is compared to: \"That which is let of the meal-offering shall be Aaron's and his sons (Leviticus 2:3).\" The twenty four perks is paralleled to the twenty four gifts of the priesthood assigned to Aaron and his sons. . . ."

If [it comes to introduce] suffering, then the suffering [in question] is unparalleled. If [it comes to introduce] joy, then the joy [in question] is unparalleled. Rabbi Yishmael came and made the [following] division. Every place where it says “vayehi” there is no joy [and every place where it says] “vehaya” there is no suffering. They challenged him [citing Genesis 1:3] “And God said, “let there be light”, and there was [vaheyi] light.” He said to them, “even this case isn’t joyous, since the world didn’t merit to use that light, for Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon said [regarding] the light created by the Holy One, blessed be He, on the first day [of creation], [that] a person could use it to see from one end of the universe to the other [from the beginning of time, to the end of time]. When the Holy One, blessed be he, saw [by this light] the deeds of the generation of Enosh, and the deeds of the generation of flood, that they were destructive, [God] arose and confiscated [the light] from them, as it is written, “Their light is withheld from the wicked,” (Job 38:15). And where was it placed? In the Garden of Eden; at it is said (Psalms 97:11): “Light is sown for the righteous, radiance for the upright” [i.e., the light of the first day of creation is reserved for the righteous in the world to come].” They challenged him [citing Genesis 1:5, which describes the first day of creation]: “And there was [vayehi] evening, and there was [vayehi] morning; day one.”  He said to them, “even this case isn’t joyous, since everything that was created on the first day is destined to be destroyed, as it is written (Isaiah 51:6): “when the heavens will melt away like smoke, and the earth wear out like a garment”.” They challenged him [citing all the other days of creation since it is written], “and there was [vayehi] evening, and there was [vayehi] morning” [regarding] the second, third, fourth, fifth, [and] sixth day. He said to them, “even this case isn’t joyous, since [the creation was incomplete such that] everything created in the six days of creation required [human] labour [in order that it should be completed]. The wheat needed grinding. Mustard needed sweetening. The Lupin bean needs sweetening. They challenged him [citing Genesis 39:2, and its description of Jospeh’s success in the house of Potiphar, which reads]: “And it was [vayehi] that God was with Joseph, and it was [vayehi] that he was a successful man.” He said to them: “even this case isn’t joyous since it was because of this [success] that that wicked woman [i.e. Potiphar’s wife] chanced upon him.\" They challenged him [citing Leviticus 9:1, and its description of the completing of the inauguration of the Tabernacle]: “And it was [vayehi] on the eighth day”. He said to them: “even this case isn’t joyous, since on that day, Nadav and Avihu died.”They challenged him [citing the description, in the book of Numbers (7:1), of Moses completing the building of the Tabernacle]: “And it was [vayehi] on the day that Moses completed the raising of the Tabernacle”. He replied to them: “even this case isn’t joyous, since on the day that it was built it [was also collapsed and] stored away.” [Rabbi Yishmael is alluding to the fact that the Tabernacle was a portable structure, and just as Moses constructed it on that day, he also tested it by taking it apart. Moreover, this symbolises that the Tabernacle was not to be permanent].\" They challenged him [by citing the verse from the book of Joshua (6:27)]: “And it was [vayehi] that God was with Joshua”. He replied to them: “even this case isn’t joyous [since it comes just before the military defeat in the city of Ai, in which Yair [son of Menashe], who was equivalent in stature to the majority of a Sanhedrin, was killed. As it says (Joshua 7:5): “And the men of Ai smote about thirty-six of [the Israelites]”. It doesn’t say [that they killed] 36 [men]; rather, it says that they killed \"about\" 36 men [literally, it says that they killed \"something like\" 36 men]. Rabbi Yudan said that this refers to Yair son of Menashe who was equivalent to the majority of a Sanhedrin [which would have 71 members; by killing him, it was as if they had killed 36 men].” They challenged him [by citing the verse from I Samuel (18:14): “And it was [Vayehi] that David was successful in all his undertakings, for the LORD was with him.” He replied to them: “even this case isn’t joyous since it is written regarding him, “From that day on Saul kept a jealous eye on David” (Ibid. 18:9).” They challenged him [by citing the verse from II Samuel (7:1)]: “And it was [vayehi] when the king was settled in his palace and God had granted him safety from all the enemies around him”. He replied to them: “even this case isn’t joyous because, on that very day, Nathan the prophet came and said to him, “Only, you will not build the Temple” (I Kings 8:19, and II Samuel 7:5).” They said to him, we have brought our own verses [as counter-examples to your theory. Now it’s your turn]. Say your own verses [as evidence for your theory]. He said to them [the following verses]: They said to him, we have brought our own verses [as counter-examples to your theory.

They challenged him. “Is it not written “And it was [vehaya] when Jerusalem was captured” (Jeremiah 38:28)?” He said to them: “even this case contains no suffering, since on that day Israel received their judgement for their sins. For Rabbi Ishmael ben Rabbi Nachman said, “Israel took a complete judgement for their sins on the day that the Temple was destroyed.

But a woman, her breasts are in a beautiful place, and the newborn nurses in a place of honor.

Yet the womb of the woman boils, and the fetus which is placed inside the womb, The Holy Blessed One protects it, it is not aborted in the shape of a bag, it is not aborted as the placenta, nor aborted in the shape of a sandal - is this not \"life and lovingkindess?\"  Thus - \"Life and lovingkindness you have given me.\"  Rabbi Tachalifa of Cesaerea If a person eats one portion of food after another portion of food, does not the second portion expel the first?  But no matter how much food a woman eats or how much liquid she drinks, the fetus is not expelled - is this not \"life and lovingkindness?\"   Rabbi Simon said, the womb of a woman is made with many cavities, many coils, and many bands.  At the moment that a woman sits on the birth chair, (the baby) does not get cast out all at once. There is a saying, \"If one band is loosened, two bands are loosened\".  Rabbi Meir said: All nine months that a woman does not see blood, she really should have seen it.  What did The Holy Blessed One do?  He removed (the blood) upward to her breasts and made it milk, so that when the baby was born there would be food for him to eat.

'Your toil is for what does not satisfy' (Isaiah 55:2) - why are you toiling, and the nations of the world satiated without satiation? Since you did not satiate yourselves from the wine of Torah, as it is written (Proverbs 9:5), 'and drink the wine that I have mixed.'\" Rabbi Berakhiah and Rabbi Chiya his father said in the name of Rabbi Yose ben Nehoria, \"It is written (Jeremiah 30:20), 'And I will remember all who press him' - even charity collectors - except for the wage of scribes and teachers of Mishnah who only take the wage of their idleness alone. But there is no creature that can give the wage of one thing of the Torah [commensurate to] its reward.\" It was taught, \"The sustenance of a man is fixed from Rosh Hashanah, except for what he expends [for] Shabbat, holidays, Rosh Chodesh and what the infants take to the house of their teacher - if he adds [to this], it is added to him; if he lessens, it is lessened from him.\" Rabbi Yochanan was travelling, he left from Tiveria [to go] to Tsipporin, and Rabbi Chiya bar Abba was helping him.

Rather when we see that Israel is coming out from in front of the Holy One, blessed be He, with their lulavs and citrons in their hands, we know that Israel are the winners (and that creates a need to offer an offering of joy, as well as the holiday offering).

And [the angels] say, \"Israel has been victorious,\" as it is stated (I Samuel 15:29),  \"Moreover, the Victory of Israel does not deceive or change His mind.\" And this is that which David says to Israel, \"If you kept the commandment of lulav - which is called pleasant, as it is stated (Psalms 16:11), 'pleasant things are ever in Your right hand' - it will certainly be announced to you that you have been victorious over the nations of the world, as it is stated, 'Moreover, the Victory of Israel.'\" Hence, Moshe warns and says to Israel (Leviticus 23:40), 'And you shall take for yourselves.'\" Rabbi Avin said, \"He has turned to the prayer of the destitute\" (Psalms 102:18).

But at the time that he would foresee and observe that evil ones were to rise from him in the future - such as Achaz, Menashe and Amon - he would call himself a poor person, as it is stated (Psalms 102:10), 'A prayer for the poor person when he is faint (<i>yaatof</i>).'\" Rabbi Alexandri explained the reading with this worker: Just like this worker sits and waits for his work to end a little and he will leave [his prayer] until the end. It is like you say (Genesis 30:42), \"and the <i>atufim</i> were for Lavan.\" What is [the understanding of ]<i>atufim</i>? Rabbi Yitschak beRabbi Chilkiyah said, \"late ones.\" Another interpretation of (Psalms 102:18), \"He has turned to the prayer of the destitute\": It should have said, \"he has not spurned his prayer. And if [it wanted to write] \"not spurned their prayer,\" it should have said, \"He has turned to the prayer of the destitute ones.\" Rather, \"He has turned to the prayer of the destitute\" - that is the prayer of Menashe, king of Yehudah, who was destitute of good deeds; \"and has not spurned their prayer\" - that is his prayer and the prayer of his ancestors. For it is written (II Chronicles 33:13), \"He prayed to Him, and He was reconciled to him.\" What is [the understanding of], \"He was reconciled (<i>vayeater</i>) to him?\" Rabbi Elazar bar Rabbi Shimon said, \"In Arabia, they enunciate, <i>chatiratah</i> (drilling), <i>atirata</i>. \"And returned him to Jerusalem to his kingdom.\" With what did He return him?

And all they have is prayer alone. David said in front of the Holy One, blessed be He, \"Master of the world, do not spurn their prayers.\" \"May this be written for the last generation\" (Psalms 102:19) - from here, [we know] that the Holy One, blessed be He, accepts penitents; \"and a people to be created will praise the Lord\" - that the Holy One, blessed be He, will create them as a new creature. Another interpretation of \"May this be written for the last generation\" - this is the generation of Hizkiyah, as he was leaning towards death; \"and a people to be created will praise the Lord\" - that the Holy One, blessed be He, created them as a new creature. Another interpretation of \"May this be written for the last generation\" - this is the generation of Mordechai, as they were leaning towards death; \"and a people to be created will praise the Lord\" - that He created them as a new creature. Another interpretation of \"May this be written for the last generation\" - these are these generations, as they are leaning towards death; \"and a people to be created will praise the Lord\" - that the Holy One, blessed be He, will create them in the future as a new creature.

The saddle still in his possession is proof that he stole it all.” All those present cried, “Woe to the one whose defense attorney becomes his prosecutor!” So too someone who takes a lulav to gain merit – if the lulav was stolen, it cries out to Hashem saying “I’m stolen property!” and the angels say, “Woe to the one whose defense attorney becomes his prosecutor!”",

[When he was] within ten <i>mil</i>, the leaders of the province went out to laud him, [so] he cancelled a third of [that tax]; within five <i>mil</i>, the middling people of the province went out to laud him, [so] he cancelled another third; when he entered the province, all of the residents of the province - men, women and children - came out and lauded him, and he cancelled it all. He said, 'What is past is past. From now, let us start a [new] reckoning.'    So [too] on the eve of Rosh Hashanah, the greats of the generations fast, and the Holy One, blessed be He, cancels a third of their iniquities; and from Rosh Hashanah to Yom Kippur, the [select] individuals fast, and the Holy One, blessed be He, cancels [another] third of their iniquities; and on Yom Kippur, everyone fasts - men, women and children. So the Holy One, blessed be He, says to Israel, 'What is past is past. From now, let us start a [new] reckoning.'\" And from Yom Kippur to Sukkot, all of Israel is involved in commandments. This one is involved with his sukkah, that one is involved with his lulav. And on the first day of the festival, all of Israel stand in front of the Holy One, blessed be He, [with] their lulavs and citrons for the sake of the Holy One, blessed be He. And He say to them, \"What is past is past. From now, let us start a [new] reckoning.\" Hence, Moshe warns Israel (Leviticus 23:40), \"And you shall take for yourselves on the first day.\" Rabbi Acha says, \"'For forgiveness is with You' (Psalms 130:4) - from Rosh Hashanah, forgiveness is waiting with You. Why so much? 'In order that You will be feared' - so as to instill fear of You upon Your creatures.\"",

I said to you (Exodus 25:2), 'and they shall take an offering for Me' in order that I will dwell among you: 'And make for Me a sanctuary' (Ibid., verse 8). As if it were possible, the Holy One, blessed be He, said, 'take Me and I will dwell among you' - it does not say, 'and they shall take an offering,' but rather, 'and they shall take (for) Me:' they are taking Me.

Behold, in another place it says (Nechemiah 8:15), \"Go out to the mountain and bring olive branches, etc\" (the verse continues to list several species and mentions myrtles alongside branches of a braided tree, seemingly indicating that they are two different species). \"And brook willows\" - all trees grow in the water!

He shoots arrows in front of them and they go by their light.\" This is [the understanding of] that which is written (Habakkuk 3:11), \"Sun [and] moon stand still on high as Your arrows fly in brightness, Your flashing spear in brilliance\"; and it is written (Joel 2:10) \"Sun and moon are darkened, and stars withdraw their brightness.\" Rabbi Hoshaya the son of Rabbi Simlai of Caesarea said in the name of Rabbi Yitschak bar Zeira, \"The sun never sets until it becomes like a type of mustard seed of blood.\" What is the reason? \"[The sun] is like a groom coming forth from the chamber, like a hero, eager to run his course (<i>orach</i>).\" And a path is only that of women, like you would say (Genesis 18:11), \"Sarah had stopped having the way (<i>orach</i>) of women.\" Rabbi Levi said, \"Each and every day, the Holy One, blessed be He, sits in judgement over the spheres of the sun and the moon, as they request not to go out to give light to the world. What do they say? 'The creatures prosecute us, the creatures bow down to us.'\" Rabbi Yosta bar Shunam said, \"What does the Holy One, blessed be He, do to them? He sits over them in judgement and they always go out and give light against their will.\" This is [the understanding of] that which is written (Zephaniah 3:5) \"He issues judgment every morning, as unfailing as the light.\" What is [the understanding of] unfailing? Not ceasing. \"The wrongdoer knows no shame\" (Zephaniah 3:5). They are not embarrassed, but rather bow down to them - they see them eclipsed and they are not embarrassed.This is [the understanding of] that which is written (Leviticus 24:2), \"and they shall take olive oil to you.\"",
            "9": "Rabbi Chiya taught, \"'Olive oil,' and not sesame oil, nut oil, radish oil or almond oil.

The king said, 'I will make dukes, governors and generals from that legion that did not rebel against me.' So [too] did the Holy One, blessed be He, say, 'This olive tree brought light to the world in the days of Noach.'\" This is [the understanding of] that which is written (Genesis 8:11), \"The dove came back to him toward evening, and there in its bill was a plucked-off (<i>taraf</i>) olive leaf!

Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said, \"It brought it from the Mount of Olives.\" Rabbi Levi said, \"It brought it from the branches of the Land of Israel.\" This is [the understanding of] what they say, \"The Land of Israel was not struck by the waters of the flood.\" This is what the Holy One, blessed be He, said to it through Yechezkel (Ezekiel 22:24), \"O mortal, say to her, 'You are an uncleansed land, not washed [by rain on the day of fury.]'\" Rabbi Yochanan said, \"Even the lower wheels of mills were dissolved by the waters (of the flood).\" Rabbi Berakhiah said, \"The gates of the Garden of Even opened for it, and it brought it from there.\" Rabbi Eyebu said to him, \"If it brought it from the Garden of Eden, did it not have something better to bring, such as cinnamon or balsam?

So too, this one's father committed incest, what is the child's sin, and how does it concern him?  \"And they have no comforter\", rather \"their oppressors are empowered\", this refers to Israel's Great Sanhedrin, who comes at them with the power of Torah, and pushes them away in the name of \"a mamzer will not enter the community of the Lord.\" (Devarim 23:3).  \"They have no comforter\" - says the Holy Blessed One: it is upon me to comfort them; in this world they are cast aside, but in the future, as Zecharia said, \"I see a people all of gold\", as it is written (Zechariah 4:2) “I see a menorah all of gold, with a bowl [gulah] above it\".
