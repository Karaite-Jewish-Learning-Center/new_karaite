            "0": "The great Rabbi Hoshaya opened [with the verse (Mishlei 8:30),] \"I [the Torah] was an amon to Him and I was a plaything to Him every day.\" Amon means \"pedagogue\" (i.e. nanny). Amon means \"covered.\" Amon means \"hidden.\" And there is one who says amon means \"great.\" Amon means \"nanny,\" as in (Bamidbar 11:12) “As a nanny (omein) carries the suckling child.\"  Amon means \"covered,\" as in (Eichah 4:5) \"Those who were covered (emunim) in scarlet have embraced refuse heaps.\" Amon means \"hidden,\" as in (Esther 2:7) \"He hid away (omein) Hadassah.\" Amon means \"great,\" as in (Nahum 3:8) \"Are you better than No-amon [which dwells in the rivers]?\" which the Targum renders as, \"Are you better than Alexandria the Great (amon), which dwells between the rivers?\" Alternatively, amon means \"artisan.\" The Torah is saying, \"I was the artisan's tool of Hashem.\" In the way of the world, a king of flesh and blood who builds a castle does not do so from his own knowledge, but rather from the knowledge of an architect, and the architect does not build it from his own knowledge, but rather he has scrolls and books in order to know how to make rooms and doorways. So too Hashem gazed into the Torah and created the world. Similarly the Torah says, \"Through the reishis Hashem created [the heavens and the earth],\" and reishis means Torah, as in \"Hashem made me [the Torah] the beginning (reishis) of His way\" (Mishlei 8:22).",
            "1": "Rabbi Yehoshua of Sichnin in the name of Rabbi Levi opened [with the verse (Tehillim 111:6),] \"The power of His works he told to His people [Yisrael].\" Why did Hashem reveal to Yisrael that which was created on the first day, and the second day [and so forth]? Because of the idolaters - so that they will not embitter Yisrael and say to them, \"Are you not a nation of thieves?\" And Yisrael would reply to them, saying, \"Aren't your own lands stolen? Didn't (Devarim 2:23) 'The Caphtorim emerge from Caphtor and destroy [the Aviyim] and settle in their stead?' [Furthermore,] the entire world belongs to Hashem; thus, when it pleased Him, He gave it to you, and when it pleased Him, He took it from you and gave it to us.\" As it is written (Tehillim 111:6), \"[In order] to give them an inheritance of the nations,\" He told [Yisrael] all of the generations.",
            "2": "\"In the beginning God created...\" Rabbi Tanchuma opened [with the verse (Psalms 86:10),] \"For You are great, and you perform wonders....\" Rabbi Tanchum said: with a pouch, if you puncture a hole in its side with a pin, all its air comes out of it.  Whereas the person is made with all kinds of hollows and holes, and his air does not leave his body.  Who could make such a thing? \"....You, God, alone.\"[the second half of the verse] When were the angels created?  Rabbi Yochanan said: the angels were created on the second day. Just as it says (in Psalms 104:4), \"He sets the rafters of the upper chambers in the water...\" [creating the sky in the upper waters which God does on the second day] and then it is written, \"He makes the winds his messengers (or, 'his angels').\"  Rabbi Chanina said: the angels were created on the fifth day, where it is written \"and let the bird fly (ye-ofef) across the earth,\" and (in Isaiah 6:2) it is written, \"and with two [wings] he (the Seraphic angel) would fly (ye-ofef).\"  Rabbi Luliana bar Tavrin said in the name of Rabbi Yitzchak: whether according to the opinion of Rabbi Chanina, or whether according to the opinion of Rabbi Yochanan, all agree that they were not created on the first day - so that they could not say that the angl Michael stretched out the south end of the sky and Gabriel the north end, and the Holy One, Blessed be He, measured out the middle.  Rather, (as it says in Isaiah 44:24), \"I am God who makes all, and who alone stretches out the heavens...with only Myself (me-iti)\"  'Mi iti' (who, with me) is written, meaning, \"WHO partnered WITH ME in the creation of the world?!?\"  Another interpretation: \"For You are great and You do wonders...\" It is the way of the world that a king of flesh and blood is praised in the land, and the great men of the land are praised with him, for they carry his burden with him.  But the Holy One, Blessed be He, is not like this.  Rather, He alone created the world.  He alone is praised in the world. He alone is glorified in his world.  Rabbi Tanchuma said: \"For you are great and You do wonders...\" Why? Because, \"...You, God, alone.\"  You, alone, created the world.",
            "3": "\"In the beginning of God's creating...\" - Six things preceded the creation of the world; some of them were created and some of them were decided to be created. The Torah and the Throne of Glory were created. How do we know the Torah was? As it says (Proverbs 8:22): \"God made me at the beginning of his way.\" How do we know the Throne of Glory was? As it says (Psalms 93:2): \"Your throne is established as of old etc.\" The Patriarchs, Israel, the Temple, and the name of the Messiah were decided to be created. How do we know the Patriarchs were? As it says (Hosea 9:10): \"Like grapes in the wilderness etc.\" How do we know Israel was? As it says (Psalms 74:2): \"Remember your congregation, whom you purchased from old.\" How do we know the Temple was? As it says (Jeremiah 17:12): \"Your throne of glory, on high from the beginning etc.\" How do we know the name of the Messiah was? As it says (Psalms 72:17): \"May his name exist forever etc. [his name shall be Yinnon as long as the sun].\" Rabbi Ahavah said in the name of Rabbi Ze'ira: Even repentance was, as it says (Psalms 90:2): \"Before the mountains were birthed,\" and at the same time (Psalms 90:3), \"You turned man to contrition etc.\" However, I do not know which was first--if the Torah preceded the Throne of Glory or the Throne of Glory preceded the Torah. Rabbi Abba Bar Cahana said: The Torah preceded the Throne of Glory, as it says (Proverbs 8:22): \"God made me at the beginning of his way, the first of his works of old.\" This is before that of which it is written (Psalms 93:2): \"Your throne is established as of old.\" Rabbi Hunna and Rabbi Yirmiyah in the name of Rabbi Shmuel the son of Rabbi Yitzchak said: The thought of Israel was before everything. This is like a king who was married to a woman and did not have a son. One time the king was in the market and said: \"Take this ink and pen for my son.\" They said: \"He does not have a son.\" He replied: \"Take them; the king must expect a son, because otherwise he would not command that the ink and pen be taken.\" Similarly, if there was no expectation of Israel receiving it after 26 generations, God would not have written in the Torah: \"Command the children of Israel\" or \"Speak to the children of Israel.\" Rabbi Bannai said: The world and its contents were only created in the merit of the Torah, as it says (Proverbs 3:19): \"God founded the world with wisdom etc.\" Rabbi Berachiyah said: In the merit of Moses, as it says (Deuteronomy 33:21): \"He saw a first part for himself.\" Rabbi Hunna said in the name of Rabbi Matanah: The world was created in the merit of three things--challah, tithes, and first fruits. The verse \"In the beginning God created\" refers to challah, as it says (Numbers 15:20): \"The beginning of your doughs.\" It also refers to tithes, as it says (Deuteronomy 18:4): \"The beginning of your grains.\" It also refers to first fruits, as it says (Exodus 23:19): \"The beginning of the fruits of the land.\"",
            "4": "Rabbi Hunna in the name of Bar Kafra opened with (Psalms 31:19): \"Let the lying lips be dumb, that speak against the righteous arrogantly with pride and contempt.\" Let them be bound, made dumb, and silenced. \"Let them be bound and made dumb\"--as it says (Exodus 4:11): \"Or who made one mute, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Was it not I, God?\" and it says (Genesis 37:7): \"We were binding sheaves in the field, and my sheaf rose.\" (The word for 'sheaf' is similar to 'mute'.) \"Let them be silenced\"--as it sounds. \"Which speak against the righteous\"--the life of all worlds (God). \"Arrogantly\"--[on matters] he has hidden from his creatures (The word for 'arrogant' is similar to 'hidden'). \"In pride\"--to boast and say: \"I can explain creation.\" \"And contempt\"--to hold My glory in contempt. As Rabbi Yossi Bar Chanina said: One who honor's oneself at the expense of one's friend has no share in the World to Come. How much more so with the honor of God! And it says afterward (Psalms 31:20): \"How abundant is Your goodness that you have laid up for those who fear You.\" Those who fear You and not for those who hold Your awe in contempt. When a king builds a palace in a place of sewers, dunghills, and garbage, everyone who says: \"This palace is built on sewers, dunghills, and garbage\" discredits it. So too, everyone who says the universe was created from nothingness discredits it. Rabbi Hunna in the name of Bar Kafra said: If it were not written, it would be impossible to say it. \"In the beginning God created\" from what? \"And the earth was empty.\"",
            "5": "Rabbi Yehudah Bar Simon opened with (Daniel 2:22): \"He reveals the deep and secret. He knows what is in the darkness, and the light dwells with Him.\" \"He reveals the deep\"--this is Hell, as it says (Proverbs 9:18): \"He does not know there are spirits there,\" and it says (Isaiah 30:33): \"deep and large\". \"And secret\"--this is Paradise, as it says (Isaiah 4:6): \"for a cover and refuge from storm and rain,\" and it says (Psalms 31:21): \"You hide them in the cover of Your presence.\" Alternatively, \"he reveals the deep and secret\"--these are the acts of the wicked, as it says (Isaiah 29:15): \"Woe to the ones who seek deep from God to make their counsel secret.\" \"And secret\"--these are the acts of the wicked, as the verse states. \"He knows what is in the dark\"--these are the acts of the wicked, as it says in Isaiah: \"Their acts are in the dark.\" \"The light dwells with Him\"--these are the acts of the righteous, as it is written (Proverbs 4:18): \"The path of the righteous is like the light at dawn,\" and it says (Psalms 97:11): \"Light is sown for the righteous.\" Rabbi Abba Srungia said: \"The light dwells with Him\"--this is the Messiah, as it says (Isaiah 60:1): \"Arise, shine, for your light has come.\" Rabbi Yehudah Bar Simon said: From the beginning of the creation of the world, \"he revealed the dark and secret\". \"In the beginning God created the heavens,\" but it is not explained. Where is it explained? Here (Isaiah 40:22): \"He stretches out the heavens like a curtain.\" \"And the land,\" but it is not explained. Where is it explained? Here (Job 37:6): \"For He says to the snow: 'Fall on the earth.'\" and (Job 38:38) \"When the dust runs into a mass, and the clods cleave together.\" \"And God said: 'Let there be light,'\" and it is not explained. Where is it explained? (Psalms 104:2) \"You cover Yourself with light like a garment.\"",
            "6": "Rabbi Yitzchak opened with (Psalms 119:160): \"The beginning of Your word is truth, and Your righteous law is forever.\" Rabbi Yitzchak said: From the beginning of the creation of the world \"the beginning of Your word is truth.\" \"In the beginning God created\"--(Jeremiah 10:10) \"Your God is true.\" \"And Your righteous law is forever\"--that for every restriction that you place on your creations, they affirm the righteousness of your judgement and accept it with faith. No creation can say that two powers created the world. It is not written: \"the gods spoke\", but rather: \"God spoke\". It is not written: \"the gods said\", but rather: \"God said\". It is not written: \"in the beginning the gods created\", but rather: \"God created\".",
            "7": "Rabbi Yehoshua Ben Levi said in the name of Rabbi Levi: Six things are required for building--water, dirt, wood, stone, rods, and iron. If you say he is rich, and does not need rods, he still needs measuring rods, as it says (Ezekiel 40:3): \"with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring rod\". The Torah preceded these with six--\"the first\", \"of old\", \"forever\", \"from the start\", and \"from the first\" which is two, in the portion (Proverbs 8:22-23): \"God made me as the beginning of His way, the first of His works of old. I was set up forever, from the start, from the first of the Earth.\"",
            "8": "A philosopher once asked Rabbah Gamliel and said to him, ''Your God is only a great artist because he found great materials that helped him: tohu and vohu, darkness, spirit, water, and the depths.\" Rabbi Gamliel responded to him: \"Your spirit should blow! Regarding all of them, the term 'creation' is written: tohu and vohu, as it says (Isaiah 45:7), 'He makes peace and creates evil'; darkness, 'He fashions light and creates darkness'; water (Tehillim 148:5), 'Praise the heavens and the waters' - why? - for 'He commanded and they were created'; spirit (Amos 4:13), 'For behold he fashions mountains and creates spirit'; the depths (Mishlei 8:24), 'When there were no depths, I was created.'\"",
            "9": "Rabbi Yonah said in the name of Rabbi Levi: Why was the world created with a \"bet\"? Just as a bet is closed on all sides and open in the front, so you are not permitted to say, \"What is beneath? What is above? What came before? What will come after?\" Rather from the day the world was created and after. Bar Kappara said: \"You have but to inquire about bygone ages that came before you [ever since God created humanity on earth]\" (Deuteronomy 4:32). From the moment God created them you may speculate, however you may not speculate on what was before that. [\"From one end of Heaven to the other\"] on this you may speculate and investigate, but you may not speculate and investigate  on what was before. Rabbi Yehudah ben Pazzi explained the Creation story according to Bar Kappara: Why was the world created with a \"bet\"? To teach you there are two worlds: this world and the world-to-come. Another interpretation: Why with a \"bet\"? Because it is an expression of \"blessing.\" And why not with an \"aleph\"? Because it is an expression of \"cursing.\" Another interpretation: Why not with an \"aleph\"? So as not to give an argument to the heretics, who would say 'how could the world endure since it was created with an expression of curse?' Rather, the Holy One of Blessing said: 'behold I create it with an expression of blessing, and hopefully it will endure.' Another interpretation: Why with a \"bet\"? The bet has two points, one on its top and one behind it, they say to the \"bet\": 'who created you?' and he points with his point on top, and says: 'the One Above created me'. 'And what is His name?' and he shows with his point of behind, and says 'Hashem is His name.' Said Rabbi Eleazar Bar Chanina in the name of Rabbi Acha: for 26 generations the \"aleph\" screamed 'injustice!' in front of the throne of the Holy One of Blessing, saying to Him: 'Master of the Universe! I am the first of the letters and You did not create the world with me!' The Holy One of Blessing said to her [the aleph]: the world and all what it contains were only created due to the merit of Torah, as it is written: \"Ad-nai set the earth with wisdom [with understanding He established the heaven]\" (Mishlei/Prov 3:19). Tomorrow I come to give Torah at Sinai and I am going to open at first instance only with you, as it says Anochi 'I am Ad-nai your God' (Exodus/Shemot 20:2). Rabbi Hoshaya says: Why is its name \"aleph\"? Because he agrees from the outset [aleph], as it says \" the word which He commanded to a thousand [eleph] generations.\"",
            "10": "R. Simon said in the name of R. Joshua b. Levi: Manzapak [מנצפ\"ך] is a Mosaic halahhah from Sinai. R, Jeremiah said in the name of R. Hiyya b. Abba: They are what the zofim [i.e. prophets] instituted.  It once happened on a stormy day that the Sages did not attend the House of Assembly [i.e. the Academy]. Some children were there and they said, 'Come and let us make a House of Assembly. Why are there written [two different forms when the following letters come in the middle or end of a word respectively] mem [מ] mem [ם], nun [נ] nun [ן], tzadi [צ], tzadi [ץ], pai [פ] pai [ף]? It teaches [that the Torah was transmitted] from utterance [מאמר] to utterance, from Faithful [נאמן] to faithful, from Righteous [צדיק] to righteous, from mouth [פה] to mouth, and from hand [כף] to hand. From utterance to utterance — from the utterance of the Holy One, blessed be He, to the utterance of Moses. From Faithful to faithful— from theAlmighty, who is designated, \"God, faithful King,\" to Moses, who is designated faithful, as it is written, \"He [Moses] is faithful in all My house\" (Numbers 12:7). From Righteous to righteous— from God, who is designated righteous, as it is written, \"The Lord is righteous in all His ways\" (Psalms 145:17), to Moses who is designated righteous, as it is written, \"He executed the righteousness of the Lord\" (Deuteronomy 33:21). From mouth to mouth — from the mouth of the Holy One, blessed be He, to the mouth of Moses. From hand to hand: from the hand of the Holy One, blessed be He, to the hand of Moses. They completed them and they grew to be great sages in Israel; some say that they were R. Eliezer, R. Joshua and R. Akiba. They applied to them the verse, \"Even a child is known by his doings, etc.\" (Proverbs 20:11).",
            "11": "Rabbi Yudan in the name of Akilus said: for Him, it is appropriate to call Him God; according to the custom in the world, a king of flesh and blood is honored in [his] domain, even at the point when he has not established amenities at public expense for it, and even at the point when he has not built amenities at private expense for it; first, he recites his name, and then his creation. But for the Unique One of the universe, first He formed and then He was named. Shimon the son of Azzai said (2 Samuel 22:36) \"your condescension has made me great\"; a flesh and blood [human] recites his name and afterwards such-and-such his title, [i.e.] X the <i>Augustalis</i>, or X whatever his title (<i>pro titulo</i>). But the Holy One, blessed be He does not act this way; only after He created the necessities of his world, then He recites his name: [which is why] \"In the beginning he created\" [comes first] and only afterwards \"God\".",
            "12": "The tana, Rabbi Shimon son of Yochai: From where [is it] that a man must not say \"a burnt offering (<i>olah</i>) to Hashem\", \"to Hashem as a meal-offering (<i>minchah</i>)\", \"a peace offering (<i>shelamim</i>) to Hashem\"? We have learned to say: [When any one of you brings] an offering (<i>qorban</i>) unto Hashem (Leviticus 1:2). See! The words are an <i>a fortiori</i> (<i>qal vechomer</i>) inference: If when one is going to dedicate [an offering] the Torah says: he should not cause the name of Heaven to be associated [with anything besides a <i>qorban</i>], then they who revile and blaspheme and engage in idolatry,  how very greatly they will be erased from the world! The rabbis said: flesh and blood builds a building, and when the building rises under his hand, he widens it as it rises, and if not, he widens it from below and makes it narrow at the top. But the Holy One, blessed be He does not act this way; rather [he created] \"the heavens\", heavens which rose by His thought, \"and the earth\" which rose by his thought. Rav Huna in the name of Rabbi Eliezer the son of Rabbi Yose the Galilean said: \"even those about which it is written: \"Now behold, I create a new heaven\" (Isaiah 65:17); already these were created since the six days of creation. This is what is written: \"For as the new heavens and the new earth [which I will make, shall remain before Me] (Isaiah 66:22), here \"new\" (<i>hadashah</i>) is not written, but rather \"the new\" (<i>hachadashah</i>).",
            "13": "Rabbi Yishmael asked Rabbi Akiva and said to him \"seeing as you served Nahum, the man from Gamzu, twenty two years, [who teaches that] <i>ach</i> and <i>raq</i> are [hermeneutic tools for] dimunition (<i>mi'ut</i>) and <i>et</i> and <i>gam</i> are [tools for] expansion (<i>ribuy</i>) what is your opinion on the <i>et</i> written here; what is it?\" and he said to him: \"if it was said \"in the beginning God created heavens and earth\" we would say that the heavens and the earth are divinities.\" He said to him \"\"for this is no empty thing for you\" (Deuteronomy 32:47) and if it seems empty to you, then it is because you do not know to interpret correctly when you are not careful with it \"for it is your life\" (Deuteronomy 32:47). When is it your life? When you are careful with it.\" But, <i>et</i> the heavens, [this <i>et</i>] expands to include the sun and moon and zodiac signs, and <i>et</i> the earth, [this <i>et</i>] expands to include the trees and grass and the Garden of Eden. Rabbi Tanchuma from Rav Huna said \"And Bezalel son of Uri son of Hur from the tribe of Judah made what Moses commanded him\" (Exodus 38:22), does it not say \"<i>et</i> all which Hashem commanded Moses\", even the words which he did not hear from the mouth of his master, he planned his judgment from what was spoken to Moses on Sinai. Rabbi Chonya in the name of Rabbi said \"\"The Torah of truth was from his mouth\" (Malachi 2:6) these are the words which he heard from the mouth of his master\". And the rabbis said \"For Hashem will be your confidence\" (Proverbs 3:26), even though you are confident in them, \"He will guard your foot from being caught\" (Proverbs 3:26)\". Rabbi Dosai said \"from erroneous decisions\". Rabbi Abbahu said \"from sin\". Rabbi Levi said \"from harm\". Said Rabbi Avdimus \"if you gave charity from your money, the Holy One, blessed be He, guards you from tariffs and from fines, from head-taxes and from forced contributions\". ",
            "14": "Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel: Beit Shammai said the heavens were created first and after that the earth was created. And Beit Hillel said the earth was created first and afterwards the heavens. From one point of view the former had reason for their words, and from another point of view the latter had reason for their words. According to the view of Beit Shammai in that they said the heavens were created first and the earth later, was the parable of a king who made a throne for himself, and then he made his footstool, as the Holy One, blessed be He said \"The heavens are my throne and the earth is the footstool of my feet\" (Isaiah 46:1). According to the view of Beit Hillel in that they said the earth was created first and the heavens created afterwards, was the parable of a king who built a palace; after he built the lower portions then he built the upper portions, thus \"In the day that the Hashem God made earth and heaven\" (Genesis 2:4). Rabbi Judah bar Ilai said \"this verse supports Beit Hillel \"before you founded the earth\" (Psalms 120:26) and [the verse supporting] afterwards \"and the heavens are the work of your hands\" (Psalms 120:26)\". Rabbi Chanin said \"from the text that was cited supporting Beit Shammai, from there Beit Hillel refute them: \"and the earth was\" (Genesis 1:2), the earth was already extant\". Rabbi Yochanan in the name of the sages said \"regarding the creation the heavens were first, and regarding completion the earth was first\". Rabbi Tanchuma said \"I will tell the reasons for this; regarding creation the heavens were first, as it is said \"In the beginning God created\" (Genesis 1:1), and regarding completion the earth was first, as it is said \"In the day that the Hashem God made earth and heaven\" (Genesis 2:4)\". Rabbi Shimon son of Yochai said \"I am amazed at how the fathers of the world, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel, were divided on the creation of the heavens and the earth, I would say to both of them that they were not created, but were like a stew pot and like its lid, as it is said \"I call unto them, they stood up together\" (Isaiah 48: 13)\"\". Said Rabbi Eliezer the son of Rabbi Shimon \"if it is according to the opinion of my father, why in one place does the earth precede  the heavens and in the other place the heavens precede the earth? This teaches that they both have weight on either side (are equal). In every place Abraham precedes Isaac and Jacob, and in one place it says \"and I will remember my covenant with Jacob\" (Leviticus 26:42); this teaches that they both have weight on either side (are equal). In every place Moses precedes Aaron, and it one place it says \"That is Aaron and Moses\" (Exodus 6:26); this teaches that they both have weight on either side (are equal). In every place Joshua precedes Caleb, and in one place it says \"except for Caleb the son of Jephuneh the Kenizzite, and Joshua the son of Nun\" (Numbers 14:30); this teaches that they both have weight on either side (are equal). In every place the turtle-dove precedes the young pigeons and in one place, it says \"and a young pigeon, or a turtle-dove for a sin offering\" (Leviticus 12:6); this teaches that they both have weight on either side (are equal). And in every place the respect for a father precedes that of a mother, and in one place it says \"You shall fear every man his mother, and his father\" (Leviticus 19:3); this teaches that they both have weight on either side (are equal).\" But the sages said: \"the father precedes the mother because he and his mother are obliged to honor his father.\" In every place the creation of the heaven precedes the earth, and in one place it says \"In the day that the Hashem God made earth and heaven\" (Genesis 2:4); this tells us that they both have weight on either side (are equal)."

And where is it? It is hidden,and is prepared for the righteous for the Future, as it says \"and the light of the moon will be like the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be seven times like the light of the seven days\" (Isaiah 30:26). This is surprising! Seven? Aren't they three (days)? Weren't the luminaries created on the fourth? Rather, it is like a person who says 'such and such way I order for the seven days of my wedding feast.' Rabbi Nechemiah said: these are the seven days of mourning for the righteous Metushelach, that the Holy One of Blessing gave to them light in abundance. 'And God saw that the light was good' - Rabbi Ze'ira the son of Rabbi Abahu explained in Cesarea: from where do we know that we do not say a blessing over the candle before its light is established? From here: and He saw; and He separated. Rabbi Yehudah in the name of Rabbi Simon said: He separated it for Himself. The rabbis say: He separated it for the righteous in the Future. This is similar to a king who had a beautiful meal and separated it for his son. Said Rabbi Berachiah: 'Rabbi Yochanan and Rabbi Shimeon ben Lakish, two great ones of the world, explained this: 'and He separated' is a complete separation. This is similar to a king who had two commanders, one to command during the day and one to command during the night, and the two were disputing with one another, one saying 'I command during the day' and the other saying 'I command during the day.' So the king called the first one and said: 'Ploni, the day will be your charge.' And so to the second and said: 'Ploni, the night will be your charge.' Said Rabbi Yochanan: 'This is what the Holy One of Blessing said to Job: \"Have you commanded the morning since your days began, and caused the dawn to know its place?\" (Job 38:12) Do you know your place? This is surprising. Said Rabbi Tanchuma: 'I will say its reason: \"Fashioner of Light and Creator of Darkness, Maker of Peace\" (Isaiah 45:7) From the moment of its creation, He makes peace. 'And God called the light day' - said Rabbi Eleazar: The Holy One of Blessing never unites His name to evil, only to goodness: it is not written 'and God called the light day; and the darkness God called night'; rather, [it is written] 'and the darkness, called night.'",

Therefore, the water is hung on a word.\" The Samaritan said to him \"Is it possible that he himself, concerning whom it is written \"Do I not fill the heavens and the earth (Jeremiah 23:24)\" was speaking with Moses from between the poles of the ark?\" Rabbi Meir responded: \"bring to me large mirrors\" and he continued \"look at yourself in what is brought; your reflection in large!\" Meir said to him \"bring me small mirrors\" and he brought small mirrors. Rabbi Meir said \"look at yourself in what is brought, your reflection is small!\" Rabbi Meir said to him \"See how if you can change yourself whenever you want, and you are flesh and blood, how much more he who spoke and the universe came into existence, blessed is He! And so when he wishes to be \"Do I not fill the heavens and the earth (Jeremiah 23:24)\" he is and when he wishes he spoke with Moses from between the poles of the ark.

This is written: \"Then Hashem answered Job out of the whirlwind (<i>se'arah</i>) (Job 38:1)\" [but read instead] from between the hairs (<i>sha'arot</i>) of his head. And still further the Samaritan asked Rabbi Meir \"Is it possible that \"the river of God is full of water (Psalm 65:10)\" from the six days of creation and has not all diminished? How strange!\" And Rabbi Meir said to him: \"Go in and wash yourself and weigh yourself when you have not gone in and then after you have gone in.\" As soon as the Samaritan left he weighed himself and his body weight was not at all diminished. Rabbi Meir said \"now all that sweat that comes out of you, did it not come out of you?\" And the Samaritan said \"yes\".

Why have You so chastised the chief of your court? Let Truth arise again from the earth.”  So it is written, (Ps. 85:12) “Truth springs up from the earth.”  The Rabbis have said the following in the name of R. Hanina bar Adai, and R. Pinchas and R. Hilkiah in the name of R. Simon who said:    “Very” [MeOD] is an anagram in reference to “Humans” [ADaM] so it is written: (Gen 1:31) “And God saw all that God had made, and found it very good.” Read it rather: “God found Humans to be good.”  R.

Humans have already been created.”  ",

And not from the hand, and yet she is a thief, as it says: \"And Rachel stole the idols\" (Genesis 31:19).  And not from the leg, and yet she is a run-about, as it says: \"And Dinah went out...\" (Genesis 34:1).",

            "3": "\"And Adam said: this is now...\"  Rabbi Yehuda bar Rebbi said: In the beginning He created her, and [Adam] saw that she was full of secretions and blood and separated her from him, and He returned and created her a second time.  As it says: \"this is now\" this is the woman this time.  This is now for me the one who will be my partner in the future.  As it says: \"A golden bell (pa'amon) and a pomegranate\" (Exodus 28:34).  \"This is now\" - this is she that perturbed me all night.  It was asked before Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish: why was Adam not tired from all his dreams, but was tired from this one [Eve]?  He said to them: because at the beginning of her creation she was just a dream, as it says: \"bone of my bones, flesh of my flesh.\"  Rabbi Tanhuma said: if a man marries a relative, of him it is written: \"bone of my bones.\"  \"This one shall be called 'woman' because she was taken from man.\"  From here we learn that Torah was given in Hebrew.  Rabbi Pinchas and Rabbi Hilkiya in the name of Rabbi Simon said: just as the Torah was given in Hebrew, so too the world was created in Hebrew.  You have heard it said: 'man' and 'woman' [in other languages as distinct words, unrelated to each other], so why ish and isha [the words for 'man' and 'woman' in Hebrew, which are related to each other]?  Because this word falls from this word [and, hence, the grammatical inconsistency is explained if the Torah was given in Hebrew].",
            "4": "\"Therefore a man will abandon.\"  It was taught: a convert that converted and was married to his sister, whether from the mother or the father - it is acceptable, according to Rabbi Meir.  The Sages say: from the mother it is acceptable, from the father, it must be established that he does not worship idols.  A refutation arose: does it not say: \"And moreover, she is my sister, the daughter of my father...\" (Genesis 20:12)!  He said to them: reply to them by their own reasoning.  Rabbi Meir refuted: \"Therefore a man will abandon his father and his mother\" (Genesis 2:24).  Rabbi Yochanan said: they explained this verse \"therefore a man will abandon his father and his mother\" the one who supports his father, the one who supports his mother.  Rabbi Abahu refuted: does it not say: \"And Amram took Yocheved his cousin\" (Exodus 6:20)!  Rabbi Shimon the son of Rabbi Abahu said: from here would we learn that  at the time of the children of Noah, Israel acted differently, before the giving of the Torah!?  Rabbi Levi said: we explain the verse \"therefore a man will abandon...\" the one who is supported by his father, or by his mother.  Rabbi Abahu in the name of Rabbi Yochanan said: the children of Noah, in matters of marriage are obligated, in matters of engagement are not.  Rabbi Yonah in the name of Rabbi Shmuel said: if a whore is in the marketplace, and two men come to her, the first is exempt and the second is liable, because he was sleeping with a married woman.  Did the first one intend to acquire her [as a wife]?!  It is said: intercourse at the time of the children of Noah acquires, even not in the way of [later] Judaism.  And how do we know that they did not divorce?  Rabbi Yehuda in the name of Rabbi Simon and Rabbi Chanin in the name of Rabbi Yochanan said: they did not divorce, or they both divorced each other.  Rabbi Yochanan said: his wife divorced him and gave him a bill of divorce.  Rabbi Hiyya taught: an idol-worshipper that divorced his wife, and she went and married someone else, and then they both went and converted to Judaism, I do not apply to them the verse \"The first husband that sent her away cannot...\" (Deuteronomy 24:4).  Rabbi Aha in the name of Rabbi Hanina bar Pappa said: in the whole book of Malachi it is written 'Hashem, Lord of Hosts' but here it is written 'the God of Israel' as it says: \"For I hate sending away, said Hashem, God of Israel\" (Malachi 2:16) - as if to say, God's name only rests on Israel.  Rabbi Haggai said: When Israel was exiled, the women's faces were blackened from the sun, and they were left and the men went and married Amonite women.  They went and circled the altar, crying, as Malachi says: \"And this do a second time\" (Malachi 2:13) - a second time in relation to Shittim.  \"Cover with tears the altar of Hashem with wailing and sighing\" (ibid.), the Holy One Blessed be He said: who will accept these tears and wailing, since you stole and did violence to and took it's beauty from her, now you will send her away?  And how do we know that they were fastidious about sexual impropriety like Israel?  As it says: \"And he cleaved to his wife\" (Genesis 2:24) and not the wife of his friend, or another man, or an animal.  Rabbi Shmuel and Rabbi Abahu and Rabbi Eleazar in the name of Rabbi Hanina said: a child of Noah who comes to his wife unnaturally is liable for the death penalty.  Rabbi Assi said: every crime written about the children of Noah is not judged on the metric of positive and negative commandments; rather, they all require the death penalty.  How do we know this?  \"And he cleaved to his wife and they became as one flesh\" (ibid.).",
            "5": "\"And they were both naked.\"  Rabbi Eleazar said: there were three who did not wait for their contentment even six hours, and these are they: Adam, and Israel, and Sisra.  Adam, as it says: \"and they were not embarrassed\" (Genesis 2:25) - six hours had not passed, and he was content.  Israel, as it says: \"And the nation saw that Moses delayed\" (Exodus 32:1), when six hours had passed and Moses had not appeared.  Sisra, as it says: \"Why does his chariot delay in coming?\" (Judges 5:28) - every day he would come in three or four hours, and today six hours have past and he is not here - these are all cases related to \"and they were not embarrassed.\"  \"And the snake was crafty\" (Genesis 3:1) - the text only needed to continue with \"And Hashem God made for Adam and his wife...\" (Genesis 3:21).  Rabbi Yehoshua ben Karchah said: to teach you which temptation the snake sprung on them - he saw them engaged in the way of the world, and desired here.  Rabbi Yaakov of the village of Hannin said: to not pause the story of the snake."

Rabbi Chiyya taught: That means that you must not make the fence more than the principal thing, lest it fall and destroy the plants.  Thus, the Holy One, blessed be, has said, \"But of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, you must not eat, for on the day you partake of it, you will surely die\" (Genesis 2:17).  Eve did not say this, but rather, \"You shall neither eat of it nor touch it\" (Genesis 3:3).  When the serpent saw her exaggerating in this manner, he grabbed her and pushed her against the tree.  \"So, have you died?\" he asked her.  \"Just as you were not stricken when you touched it, so will you not die when you eat from it.\"",

When Cain sinned, it left to the second, in the generation of Enosh to the third, in the generation of the flood to the fourth, in the generation of the tower of Babel to the fifth, in the generation of Sedom to the 6th, in the generation of the Egyptians to the 7th. 7 righteous men arose corresponding to them: Avraham, Yitzchak, Ya'akov, Levi, Kehos, Amram and Moshe. Avraham brought it down to the 6th, Yiztchak brought it down from the 6th to the 5th, Ya'akov brought it down to the 5th to the 4th, Levi brought it down from the 4th to the 3rd, Kehos brought it down from the 3rd to the 2nd, Amram brought it down from the 2nd to the 1st, and Moshe brought it down from above to below.

Another interpretation: And Adam knew - he knew from what bliss he was expelled; he knew what Chava did to him. Said Rav Acha: Chivyiah [the snake] is your snake, and you are the snake of Adam. 'And she conceived and gave birth to Kayin' - Said Rabbi Eleazar ben Azaryiah three wonders happened on that day:on that day they were created, on that day they had relations, on that day they had children. Said Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korcha: two went up to the bed and seven descended, Kayin and his female twin, Hevel and his two female twins.

He [Akiva] answered: if it were written 'I acquired a man of God [w/o the 'et']' that would be a difficult thing, rather it says 'I acquired a man with God'. He said to him: 'Because this is not an empty thing for you' (Devarim 32:47), and if it was empty, it is because of you, because you cannot LIDROSH, rather 'with God' [means] that in the past Adam was created from the adamah and Chavah was created from the adam.

'And Ad-nai said to Kayin: why are you so angry, and why is your face fallen? (Gen. 4:7) is it not that, when you do good, you  rise up [se'et] ? [this is] blessing, just as you say 'and Aharon lift [vayisa'] up his hands to the people and blessed them' (Lev. 9:22). 'And if you don't do good, lift' [this is] curse, as it is written 'and cause them to carry [lift on shoulders] the iniquity of guilt' (Lev. 22:16). Another interpretation: if you do goof I forgive all your sins, and if not, the sin of that same man is heaped to excess. Rabbi Berachia in the name of Rabbi Shime'on the son of Ami said: Of David, a maskil, happy is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is pardoned.' (Ps. 22:1) - Happy is the person who is higher/greater from his sin, and whose sin is not higher/greater than him,as it says 'sin crouches at the door'.  It is not written here 'she crouches' [chatat is feminine] but 'he crouches' - in the beginning the sin is weak like a lady, and after it strengthens as a male. Said rabbi Akiva: in the beginning it looks like a thread of a spider, and at the end it becomes like the rope of a boat, since it is written: 'Oy to those who draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and as the ropes of a cart, sin' (Isaiah 5:18). Said Rabbi Itzchak: at first it makes itself a guest, and later becomes the master of the house, since it is written: '[And there came a traveler to the rich man] and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man' - here is the guest - 'that had come to him, but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that had come to him. '(II Sam. 12:4) - this is the master of the house. Rabbi Tanchum bar Merion said: there are dogs in Rome that know how to insinuate themselves, [the dog] goes and sits in front of a shop, and he pretends to take a nap, and the shopkeeper takes a nap, and the dog lets a bread roll fall near the ground, and and as onlookers are collecting [the scattered pile] the dog gets a bread roll for himself. Said Rabbi Aba: this impulse is similar to robbers, [such as] a person bent over, who was sitting at crossroads who would say to to everyone who passed 'give me what you have!' A smart one passed and saw that there was nothing he could do to rob him, and began to hit him. So too, the impulse for evil [yetzer hara] destroyed a few generations, the generation of Enosh, and the generation of the tower [dor haplagah] and the generation of the flood, when Avraham Avinu stood up and saw that [the yetzer hara] had nothing, began hitting him, since it is written 'And I will beat to pieces his adversaries before him, and smite them that hate him.' (Ps. 89:24). Said Rabbi Ami: The yetzer hara does not walk by the sides, rather, he walks by the middle of the square, and the moment he sees a man rolling his eyes, fixing his hair, and lifting his heel, he says: 'this one is mine!' What is the reason? 'Do you see a man wise in his own eyes? Sin has hope in him' (Prov. 26:12). Said Rabbi Avin: whoever indulges his yetzer [impulse to evil] in his youth, his end will be to be to managed by him. Rabbi Chanina bar Papa said: if your yetzer came to tempt you [lit. to make you desire] send him away with words of Torah, if you do so I rise you up as if you created peace itself, as it says: 'The yetzer near you, go out in battle of perfect peace [shalom shalom]' (Isaiah 26:3) if you do so I rise you up as if you created peace itself since not only peace is written here, but peace, peace. And if you say that it is not in your power to do so, the text says: 'because in you/You He/he trusts' (Isaiah 26:3).

Rather, in the hour that the Holy One created Adam HaRishon (the First Human), He made him rule over all, the cow would listen to the plowman and the furrow would listen to the plowman. Since Adam sinned they rebelled against him, the cow would not listen to the plowman and the furrow would not listen to the plowman. When Noach stood/was established, they rested (nachu). And from where do we have this? Here we have the expression of rest (nichah), and there we have the expression of rest: \"so that your ox and your donkey will rest (yanuach)\" (Ex. 23:12).

Here we have the expression of rest (nichah), and there we have the expression of rest: \"Yet they shall come to peace, they shall have rest on their resting place, [the ones who walked straightforward].\" (Isaiah 57:2). Just as in that case the expression has to do with the resting in the grave, so too here.

Rabbi Yosi bar Rabbi Chanina said: He was named after the resting of the ark, as it says \"and the ark rested [tanach]\" (Gen. 8:4). Rabbi Yochanan said: the celestial spheres did not move that entire twelve months. Rabbi Yonatan said to him: they did move, but their movements were not marked. \"(So long as the earth endures, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night) shall not cease\" (Gen 8:22) - Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbu Yehoshua dispute. Rabbi Eliezer said: shall not cease, from here [we infer] that they did not cease.  And Rabbi Yehoshua: shall not cease, from here [we infer] that they did cease."

According to Rabbi Yehudah's opinion: \"Fortunate is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked\", that's the generation of Enosh. \"and in the ways of the sinner he does not stand,\" that's the generation of the Flood. \"and the company of mockers he does not sit,\" that's the generation of the Division. \"Rather, in God's Torah is his desire\" (Psalms 1:2), that is [i.e., refers to] the seven commandments he was commanded. \"and in his Torah he meditates day and night\"  - he comprehended one matter implied by [lit. \"from within\"] another matter: he [Noach] said [to himself], \"What is the reason the Torah increased [the number of] ritually pure [beasts], more than the [number of] ritually impure [beasts]? Was it not because He wants [me] to sacrifice from them?\" Immediately, \"and he took from all the ritually pure beasts...\" (Genesis 8:20). \"and he shall be like a tree planted by water brooks\" (Psalms 1:3) = G-d planted him in the ark. \"which gives its fruit at the proper time\" - that is [i.e., refers to] Shem, \"its leaves shall not wither\" = that is Ham, \"and all that it does shall prosper\" - that is Yefet.",

After some time, a crawling animal passed in front of his daughter and she wanted to kill it.

They are the laws of the Babylonians. At the end of thirty days, Eliyahu - may he be remembered for good - came in the likeness of Rabbi Chiya the Great to our rabbi and put his hand on his teeth and he became healed. When Rabbi Chiya the Great came to our rabbi, he said to him, \"What did you do to your teeth?\" He said [back] to him, \"From the time that you put your hand on them, they became better.

One of them interpreted and said to them: \"So it is written: \"Then Joshua blessed them and dismissed them, and they went to their homes (Joshua 22:6)\". Teaching what does it say: \"Furthermore, when Joshua sent them off to their homes, he blessed them (Joshua 22:7)\"? Rather at the time when Israel was conquering and dividing the land the tribe of Reuben and Gad were with them and did that for fourteen years and they received farewells from Joshua to go \"to their tents\". And they were there several days further and they repeated the receiving of farewells from him for a second time, and so it is said: \"<i>Furthermore</i>, when Joshua sent them\". Rabbi Yudan said: \"The tribe of Reuben and Gad were the attendants of Joshua and joined with him at the Jordan, and when they saw that his attendants were lessened they returned and joined up with him until his house. The later blessing was greater than the first; see! It is written: \"and said to them, “Return to your homes with great wealth—with very much livestock, with silver and gold, with copper and iron, and with a great quantity of clothing. Share the spoil of your enemies with your kinsmen (Joshua 22:8)\"\". And another interpreted that thus it is written: \"On the eighth day he let the people go. They bade the king good-bye  (1 Kings 8:66)\". Teaching what does it say: \"On the twenty-third day of the seventh month he dismissed the people to their homes. They bade the king goodbye (2 Chronicles 7:10)\"? Rather they received a farewell from him, and they stayed there several days afterward and they repeated the receiving of farewells a second time, and thus is it said: \"On the twenty-third day of the seventh month he dismissed the people\". Rabbi Levi said: \"It is written: \"They observed the dedication of the altar seven days, and the Feast seven days (2 Chronicles 7:9)\": do you not have seven days before the festival which had among them Shabbat and Yom Kippur, and Israel was drinking, eating, rejoicing, and lighting lights for seven days? And finally they returned and felt upset about the matter. They said: \"You will say that in our hands is a sin because we desecrated Shabbat and did not fast on Yom Kippur\". And so to pacify them that the Holy One, blessed be He, was pleased with their deeds, he emitted a divine voice that said to them: \"All of you are from the children of the World to Come\", and the later blessing was greater than the first, as it is said: \"and went to their homes, joyful and glad of heart (1 Kings 8:66)\". Rabbi Yitzchak said: \"\"Joyful\" because they found their wives pure, and \"glad of heart\" because they became pregnant with males\". Rabbi Levi said: \"He emitted a divine voice that said to them: \"All of you are from the children of the World to Come\"\".

Rather \"and the oil stopped (2 Kings 4:6)\" because the oil was more valuable, and she came to ask if she should sell or not sell. The later blessing was greater than the first: \"And you and your children can live on the rest (2 Kings 4:7)\": until the dead live. And when Shimon son of Yochai saw them that they were people of refinement, he sent with them one companion of the scholars to know what they were interpreting on the road and one of them interpreted: \"As it is written: \"The angel of God, who had been going ahead of the Israelite army, now moved and followed behind them (Exodus 14:19)\". Teaching what does it say: \"And the pillar of cloud shifted from in front of them and took up a place behind them\"? Rather this is the measure of judgment because it was threatening Israel the Holy One, blessed be He, turned it around and it threatened the Egyptians\". And another interpreted: \"It is written: \"<b>When the bow is in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and all living creatures, all flesh that is on earth</b> (Genesis 9:15): \"<b>between God</b>\": this is the measure of judgment above, \"<b>and all living creatures, all flesh that is on earth</b>\": this is the measure of judgment below. The measure of judgment about is hard, and the measure of judgment below is bendable\". And one from them interpreted: \"Wisdom is better than rubies; no goods can equal her (Proverbs 8:11)\" and in another place it says: \"She is more precious than rubies; all of your goods cannot equal her (Proverbs 3:15)\". \"Your goods\": these are the commandments and good deeds. \"Your goods\": these are gemstones and pearls\". Rabbi Acha in the name of Rabbi Tanchuma son of Rabbi Chiyya: \"My goods and your goods cannot equal her \"For only in this should one glory: In his earnest devotion to Me. For I Hashem act with kindness, Justice, and equity in the world; For in these I delight —declares the Hashem (Jeremiah 9:23)\". The Parthian King Artaban sent to Rabbi Judah a priceless pearl and he said to him: \"Send to me something of a value like the value of this\". So Rabbi sent to him a <i>mezuzah</i>. He sent and said to him: \"I sent to you an item of great value and you sent to me an item whose value is one <i>polar</i>!\" He said to him: \"My goods and your goods cannot equal her\". And further you sent me something that it is necessary for me to protect, but I sent you something which is full of knowledge and will protect you, as it is said: \"When you walk it will lead you; When you lie down it will watch over you; And when you are awake it will talk with you (Proverbs 6:22)\": \"When you walk it will lead you\" in this world. \"When you lie down it will watch over you\": in the time of death. \"And when you are awake it will talk with you\": in the future to come\"."

'<b>And laid it upon both their shoulders and went backwards and covered their father's nakedness</b>' but since it is written '<b>went backwards</b>' don't we [already] know that they did not see their father’s nakedness?

Rabbi Yudan and Rabbi Huna disagree [on what ‘<i>be-sarbelehon</i>’ means]: Rabbi Yudan said: It means in their prayer cloaks; Rabbi Huna said: It means in their robes of state.

By your life [I swear that] I will reward you 'for it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give to Gog a place fit for burial in Israel’ (Ezek. 39:11) The Holy One of Blessing said to Ham: ‘You brought your father’s nakedness to disgrace: By your life [I swear that] I will punish you: 'So shall the king of Assyria lead away the captives of Egypt, and the exiles of Ethiopia, young and old, naked and barefoot, and with buttocks uncovered to the shame of Egypt’ (Isa. 22:4).",

He said: <b>Cursed be Canaan</b>. Rabbi Nehemiah explained: It was Canaan who saw it [in the first place] and informed them, therefore the curse is attached to him who did wrong. Rabbi Berekiah said: Noah grieved very much in the Ark that he had no young son to wait on him, and declared, ‘When I go out I will beget a young son to do this for me.’ But when Ham acted thus to him, he exclaimed, ‘You have prevented me from begetting a young son to serve me, therefore that man [your son] will be a servant to his brethren!’ Rabbi Huna said in Rabbi Yosef’s name: [Noah declared], ‘You have prevented me from begetting a fourth son, therefore I curse your fourth son,’ Rabbi Huna also said in Rabbi Yosef’s name: You have prevented me from doing something that is done in the dark, therefore your seed will be ugly and dark-skinned. Rabbi Hiya said: Ham and the dog copulated in the ark, therefore Ham came forth black-skinned while the dog publicly exposes its copulation. Rabbi Levi said: This may be compared to one who minted his own coinage in the very palace of the king, whereupon the king ordered: I decree that his effigy be defaced and his coinage cancelled.

For were it not for you, I would not have created heaven and earth, as it is said (Isa. 40:22]), \"Stretched them out like a tent to dwell in.\"  For were it not for you, I would not have made the orb of the sun, as it is said (Ps. 19:5), \"He placed in them a tent for the sun.\"  For were it not for you, I would not have made the moon, as it is said (Job 25:5), \"Even the moon is not bright [ya'ahil].\"  R' Levi said, In the future, Avraham will be sitting at the entrance to Gehinnom, and he will not allow a circumcised Jew to go down into it.  And those who have sinned too much, what does he/He do to them?  He removes the foreskin from babies who have died before they were circumcised, places it on them, and causes them to go down to Gehinnom.  Thus it is said (Ps. 55:21), \"He harmed his ally, he broke his pact.\"  \"In the heat of the day\" (Gen. 18:1).  When that day comes about which is written (Mal. 3:19), \"For lo! That day is at hand, burning like an oven.\"  \"In the heat of the day.\"  R' Yishmael taught, \"In the heat of the day,\" this refers to six hours of the day [noon].  So then how do I interpret (Ex. 16:21), \"when the sun grew hot, it would melt\"?  To four hours.   You say four hours; might it not be six hours?  When it says, \"In the heat of the day,\" this refers to six hours.  Or maybe it's the reverse -- \"In the heat of the day\" to four hours, and \"when the sun grew hot\" to six hours.  You would say, how can you interpret \"In the heat of the day\" as four hours?  Isn't it the case that, at four hours, there is heat only in a spot where the sun shines.  At four hours, in the shade it is cool, and in the sun it is hot; at six hours, in the shade and the sun alike are hot.  Thus you should not go by the latter version, but rather by the former:  \"In the heat of the day\" is six hours, and \"when the sun grew hot\" is four hours, and only in a spot where the sun shone would it melt.

Ishmael taught: This term 'making sport' refers to idolatry, as in the verse, \"And the people sat to eat and drink and got up to make sport' (Exodus 32:6). This teaches that Sarah saw Ishmael build altars, catch locusts, and sacrifice them. R. Eleazar said: The term 'making sport' refers to bloodshed, as in the verse, \"Let the young men, please, arise and make sport before us\" (II Sam. 2:14) Rabbi Azariah said in Rabbi Levi’s name: Ishmael said to Isaac: 'Let us go and see our pieces in the field' and he would pick up the bow and shoot arrows, aiming in Itzchak's direction, while pretending to be playing (making sport), as it is written: \"as a madman who casts fire-brands, arrows, and death; so is the man that deceives his neighbor, and said: 'I am just joking (making sport)'.

And why did God not reveal it to him without delay? In order to make him [Itzchak] even more beloved in his eyes and reward him for each and every word spoken. This agrees with the opinion of Rabbi Yohanan, who said: \"Get out of your country\" (Gen. 12:1) means from your province; “And from your kindred” (Gen. 12:1)—from your neighborhood; “And from your father’s house\"(Gen. 12:1)—literally your father’s house. “To the land that I will show you” (Gen. 12:1).

Hayata said: ‘Get you’ is written twice, and we do not know which was more precious [in the eyes of God] the first or the second.

Similarly regarding the Holy of Holies (devir), Rabbi Chiya and Rabbi Yanai [disagree]: one says from the place from which the commandments (dibra’ot) go out to the world, and one says from the place from which speech (dibur) goes out to the world. Similarly regarding the ark (aron), Rabbi Chiya and Rabbi Yanai [disagree]: one says to the place from which the light (ha’orah) goes out to the world, and one says to the place where awe (yirah) goes out to the world.

Let the saddling done by our father Avraham in order to go and fulfill the will of the One at whose word the world came into existence counteract the saddling done by Bilam in order to go and curse Israel. Let preparing counteract preparing. Let Yosef’s preparing [of his chariot] to meet his father counteract Pharaoh’s preparing to go and pursue Israel.

Said Rabbi Levi: Enough of this! In truth Avraham acted according to his powers an the Holy One of Blessing according to His powers. \"And he rose up, and went to the place.\" (Gen. 22:3) Avraham was rewarded for rising up and for going."

Levi: We will go and see what is to be the eventual outcome of Koh. “And we will worship, and we will come back to you.” He informed him [through these words] that he [Itzchak] would return safely from Mount Moriah. R. Itzchak said: Everything happened as a reward for worshipping. Abraham returned in peace from Mount Moriah only as a reward for worshipping. “And we will worship, and we will come back to you.” Israel were redeemed only as a reward for worshipping: “And the people believed … then they bowed their heads and worshipped” (Ex. 4:31). The Torah was given only as a reward for worshipping: “And worship y’all afar off” (Ex. 24:1). Hannah was remembered only as a reward for worshipping: “And they worshipped before the Lord” (I Sam. 1:19). The exiles will be reassembled only as a reward for worshipping: “And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great horn shall be blown; and they shall come that were lost … and that were dispersed … and they shall worship Ad-nai in the holy mountain at Jerusalem” (Isa. 27:13). The Temple was built only as a reward for worshipping: “Exalt y’all Ad-nai our God, and worship at His holy mountain” (Ps. 99:9). The dead will come to life again only as a reward for worshipping: “O come, let us worship and bend the knee; let us kneel before Ad-nai our Maker (Ps 95:6).",
            "2": "And Avraham took the wood of the burnt-offering (Gen. 22:6) — like one who carries his own stake [to be impaled] on his shoulder. \"And he took in his hand the fire and the knife (Ma’akheleth)\" (Gen. 22:6). R. Hanina said: Why is a knife called ma’akheleth? Because it makes food (okhlim) fit to be eaten. While the Rabbis said: All eating (akhiloth) which Israel enjoy in this world, they enjoy only in the merit of that ma’akheleth (knife). \"And they went both of them together (Gen. 22:6): one to bind and the other to be bound, one to slaughter and the other to be slaughtered.",
            "3": "“And Itzchak spoke to Avraham his father, and said: My father” (Gen. 22:7). Samael went to the our father Avraham and said: “Old man, old man! Have you lost your mind [lit. have you lost your heart]? You are going to slay a son given to you at the age of a hundred!’ ‘Even this I do,’ replied he. [Samael said:] ‘And if He sets you an even greater test, can you stand it?!’ [as it is written] “If a thing be put to you as a trial, will you be wearied” (Job 4:2)? ‘Even more than this,’ he replied. [Samael said:] ‘Tomorrow He will say to you, “You are guilty of murder, you murdered your son!” He replied: ‘Still I go’. Seeing that he could achieve nothing with him, he approached Itzchak and said: ‘Son of an unhappy mother! He is going to slay you!’ He replied: ‘Still I go’. Samael said: ‘If so, all those fine tunics which your mother made be a legacy for Ishmael, the hated of her house, and you don't care [lit. don't let it enter your heart]?’ If a word is not completely effective, it may yet be effective in part, that’s why it is written, “And Itzchak spoke to Avraham his father, and said: My father”: why [his] father, [my] father twice? So that he should be filled with compassion for him. \"And he said: Behold, the fire and the wood. Avraham said to him: ‘May that man who has thus seduced him be drowned! Any way, “God will provide himself the lamb, my son”; and if not you are “the lamb for the burnt-offering my son.” So \"they went both of them together\" (Gen. 22:8) — one to slaughter and the other to be slaughtered.",
            "4": "\"And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Avraham built the altar there\" (Gen. 22:9). And where was Itzchak? Said Rabbi Levi: he had taken and hidden him, saying, 'Lest he who sought to seduce him throw a stone at him and disqualify him from being a sacrifice.' \"And Avraham built the altar there etc and bound Itzchak his son\". Rabbi Hanina bar Itzchak said: As our father Avraham was binding his son Itzchak below, so the Holy One of Blessing was binding the [angel] princes of the heathens above. Yet they did not remain [bound]. For when Israel separated themselves in the days of Jeremiah the Holy One of Blessing said to them: ‘What do you think: that those fetters still exist?’ as it says, \"For shall they be like tangled thorns (sirim)\" (Nahum 1:10), which means: For are the Princes (sarim) to be tangled [i.e. bound] forever? No; for when they [the Israelites] are “drunken according to their drink” (Nahum 1:10), their fetters are broken, for it is written, \"They shall be devoured as stubble fully dry\" (Nahum 1:10). When our father Avraham stretched forth his hand to take the knife to slay his son, the angels wept, as it says, “Behold, their valiant ones [the angels] cry without — hutzah” (Isa. 33:7). What does ‘hutzah’ mean? R. ‘Azariah said: It is unnatural. It is unnatural that he should slay his son with his own hand. And what did they say? The highways lie wasted? (Isa. 33:8) — does not Avraham show hospitality to travelers? The wayfaring man ceased — shavat (Isa. 33:8) — as in the verse, It had ceased (hadal) for Sarah (Gen. 18:2). \"He has broken the covenant\" (Isa. 33:8), [similar to] “But My covenant will I establish with Itzchak” (Gen. 17:21). “He has despised the cities (Isa. 33:8), “And [Avraham] dwelt between Kadesh and Shur” (Gen. 20:1). He regards not man (Isa. 33:8) — has Avraham no merit in his favor? This is surprising! And who says that this verse does not refer to the angels? — Here it says, “Upon (MI-MA’AL) the wood”, while in another passage it says, “above (mi-ma’al) Him stood the seraphim” (Isa. 6:2).",
            "5": "And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife (Gen. 22:10). Rav asked R. Hiyya the Elder: How do we know that ritual slaughtering must be with a movable object? From here: \"And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife\" — he said: if he told you this from a Haggadah, he might retract; and if he stated it as a tradition, he cannot not retract from it, since Levi taught: If they [sharp flints] were attached [to the ground or rocks] from the very beginning, they are unfit; but if they had been originally detached but subsequently fixed in the ground, they are fit, since we learned: \"If one slaughters with a hand-sickle, a harvest sickle, a flint, or a reed, the slaughtering is fit.\" Said Rabbi Yosei: Five things were said of a reed stalk: You may not slaughter, circumcise, cut meat, wipe your hands, nor pick your teeth with it, because an evil spirit rests upon it.",
            "6": "\"And the angel of Ad-nai called to him out of heaven, and said: Abraham, Abraham\" (Gen. 22:11). Rabbi Hiya taught: This is an expression of love, this is an expression of urging. Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov said: He spoke to him and to future generations, there is no generation which does not contain people like Avraham, and there is no generation which does not contain people like Yaakov, Moshe, and Shmuel. And he said: \"Do not lay your hand etc.\" (Gen. 22:12) Where was the knife? Three tears had fallen from the angels of service and the knife dissolved. Avraham said: ‘I will strangle him,’ He said: ‘Do not lay your hand upon the lad.’ [Avraham] said ‘I will take a drop of blood from him’ - He said to him: ‘Neither do anything [me'uma] to him’ [meaning] inflict no blemish [muma] upon him. \"Because now I know\" [meaning] I have made it known to all that you love Me, \"and you have not withheld, etc\". And do not say that all ills that do not affect one’s own body are not ills, rather I ascribe merit to you as though I had told to you to sacrifice yourself and you did not refuse.",
            "7": "Another explanation: Rabbi Itzchak said, \"At the time that Avraham sought to bind Itzchak, his son, [the latter] said to him, 'Father, I am a young man and I am concerned lest my body shake from fear of the knife and I will trouble you, and lest the slaughtering will be invalid and it will not be considered a sacrifice for you. Rather, tie me very well.' Immediately, ‘and he bound Itzchak.' Could he really tie up a man of thirty-seven (a different version: of twenty six years)? Rather, it was with his agreement. Immediately. 'And Avraham sent his hand.' He sends his hand to take the knife and his eyes brings down tears and the tears fall onto the eyes of Itzchak from the mercy of his father. And nonetheless, the heart was happy to do the will of his Maker. And the angels gathered in many groups above them. What did they yell out? 'The ways have become desolate, the wayfarer has ceased; He has rescinded His covenant; He has become disgusted with the cities' (Isaiah 33:7) – He does not desire Jerusalem and the Temple that he had in mind to bequeath to the children of Itzchak. 'He did not consider a man' – merit did not stand Avraham well: 'No creation has importance in front of Me.'\" Rabbi Acha said, \"Avraham started to wonder, 'These words are only words of wonder. Yesterday, you told me (Genesis 21:12), \"Because in Itzchak will your seed be called.\" And [then] you went back and said, \"Please take your son.\" And now You say to me, \"Do not send your hand to the youth.\" It is a wonder!' The Holy One, blessed be He, said, 'Avraham, \"I will not profane My covenant and the utterances of My lips, I will not change\" (Psalms 89:35) – When I said, \"Please take your son,\" I did not say, \"slaughter him,\" but rather, \"and bring him up.\" For the sake of love did I say [it] to you: I said to you, \"Bring him up,\" and you have fulfilled My words. And now, bring him down.’ [A different version: They said a parable about a king that said to his friend, 'Bring up your son to my table.' His friend brought him up and his knife was in his hand. The king said, 'And did I say to you, \"Bring him up to eat him?\" I said to you, \"Bring him up\"' – [and this was] because of [the king's] love.) This is [the meaning of] what is written (Jeremiah 19:5), 'it did not come up on My heart' – that is Itzchak.\"]",
            "8": "\"And Avraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold another (achar) ram (Gen. 22:13)\". What does ahar mean? Said Rabbi Yudan: After (achar) all that happened, Israel still fall into the clutches of sin and be the victims of persecution; yet they will be ultimately redeemed by the ram’s horn, as it says, “[And Ad-nai will manifest Himself to them, and His arrows shall flash like lightning,] Ad-nai E-lohim shall sound the ram’s horn [and advance in a stormy tempest]” (Zech. 9:14). Rabbi Yehudah bar Rabbi Simon: After [achar] all generations Israel will fall into the clutches of sin and be the victims of persecution; but their end is to be redeemed by the ram’s horn, as it says, ‘And Ad-nai E-lohim will blow the horn,’ etc. Rabbi Hanina b. R. Isaac said: All days of the year Israel are in sin’s clutches and are victims of prosecutions, but on New Year they take the shofar and blow on it, and are remembered by the Holy One of Blessing and He forgives them, and their end is to be redeemed by the ram’s horn, and it says, \"And Ad-nai E-lohim will blow the horn.\" Rabbi Levi said: Because Avraham our Father saw the ram extricate himself from one thicket and go and become entangled in another, the Holy Oneof Blessing said to him: ‘So is the future of your children to be entangled in reigns, from Babylon to Media, from Media to Greece, and from Greece to Edom; and their end will be to be redeemed by the ram’s horn,’ as it is written, “And Ad-nai E-lohim will blow the horn.” “And Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt-offering in the stead of his son (Gen.22:13). Rabbi Banai said: he said in front of Him: ‘Sovereign of the Universe! Look upon the blood of this ram as though it were the blood of my son Itzchak; its lambs as though they were my son’s lambs(descendants),’ even as we learned: When a man declares: This animal be instead of this one, in exchange for that, or a substitute for this, it is a valid exchange. Rabbi Pinchas said: he said in front of Him: ‘Sovereign of the Universe! Regard it as tough I had sacrificed my son Itzchak first and achar (after) this ram in the stead of him, as in the verse, “And Iotam his son reigned in his stead” (II Kings 15:7). It is even as we learned; \"[When one declares 'I vow a sacrifice] like the lamb or like the animals of the Temple stalls” (Nedarim 10b, Mishnah Nedarim 1:3) - R. Yochanan said: he meant, like the lamb of the daily burnt-offering; Resh Lakish said: he meant, like Itzchak’s ram. There [in Babylon] they say: Like the off-spring of a sin-offering. Bar Kappara taught: He meant like the lamb which has never given suck.",
            "9": "\"And Avraham called the name of the place \"Ad-nai Yireh\" [Ad-nai will see] (Gen. 22:14). Rabbi Yochanan said \"he said to Him: 'Master of Worlds, at the hour that you said to me \"Take please your son, your only son\" (Gen. 22:2), I had what to respond. Yesterday You said \"For through Itzchak [will I make your line great]\" (Gen. 21:22) but now \"Take please your son\"!? And God forbid that I don't do as you've asked me; instead, I conquered my mercy to do Your will. May it be your will, Ad-nai our God, that in the hour when the sons of Itzchak come to do transgressions and bad deeds, that this very Binding [Akeidah] be remembered for them, and may You be filled with Mercy on them!' Avraham called it \"Yireh\", as it says \"and Avraham called the name of the place Ad-nai Yireh.\" Shem called it Shalem, as it says \"And Malchitzedek, the king of Shalem...\"(Genesis 14:18) The Holy One of Blessing said \"If I call it Yireh, as Avraham called it, then Shem, who was a righteous man, will become angry; and if I call it Shalem, Abraham, who was a righteous man, will be angry. Instead, I call it Yerushalayim [Jerusalem], as they called it together: Yireh Shalem. Jerusalem. Rabbi Berechiah said in Rabbi Helbo’s name: While it was Shalem, the Holy One of Blessing made for Godself a sukkah [booth] and prayed in it, since it says \"In Shalem is set His tabernacle, and His dwelling-place in Tzion\" (Psalms 76:3). And what did He say? ‘May it happen that I see the building of My house.\" Another interpretation: It [this verse] teaches that the Holy One of Blessing showed him the Temple destroyed and built, destroyed and build [a second time], since it says: \"the name of that place Ad-nai Yireh\" (Ad-nai sees): this is it built, as you say [the verse] \"Three times in a year shall all your males be seen [yira'eh] (Deut. 16:16). \"As it is said to this day in the Mountain of Ad-nai [is seen, Heb. yira'eh]\" (Gen.22:14) This is it destroyed, as in the verse \"on the mountain of Tzion, which is desolate\" (Lam. 5:18). \"Ad-nai is seen\" this is it built and perfected in the future to come as the topic [in the verse] that is said: \"When Ad-nai built Tzion, He will be seen in His glory\" (Psalms 102:17).",
            "10": "\"And the angel of Ad-nai called to Avraham a second time from heaven, and said: 'By Myself I have sworn\" (Gen. 22:15-16). Why was this oath needed? He [Avraham] said to Him: ‘Swear to me not to test me ever again, nor my son Itzchak.’ This is similar to one who was saving his basin from being swallowed by the river, and his son jumped into it with him. Another interpretation: why was this oath needed? Rabbi Chama ben Rabbi Chanina said: He said to Him ‘swear to me not to test me ever again’ This is similar to a king who was married to a noble lady, she gave birth to her first son and he divorced her; [he remarried her and then she gave birth to] a second son, and he divorced her; a third son, and he divorced her; and when she gave birth to the tenth son, they all assembled and demanded of him: ‘Swear to us not to divorce our mother ever again.’ So too when our father Avraham was tested the tenth time, he said to Him: ‘Swear to me that You will not to test me ever again.’ Rabbi Chanin said: \"Because you have done [asita] this thing\" (Gen. 22:17) — it was the tenth [asiri] trial, and you say \"because you have done this thing!\" Rather, this is the last test, which was as weighty as all the rest together, and if he had not accepted to [do] it, all would have been lost. [A different version: all that he did would have been lost.] \"I will verily bless you, etc.\" (Gen. 22:17) a blessing for the father and a blessing for the son. \"And I will verily multiply\"(Gen. 22:17) : increase for the father and increase for the son. \"And your seed shall inherit the gate of his enemies\"(Gen. 22:17). Rabbi said: This is Tadmor, happy is anyone who sees the downfall of Tadmor which took part in both destructions. Rabbi Yudan and R. Chanina — one of them said 'at the destruction of the first Temple it supplied eighty thousand archers.[A different version: truth tellers (?)] and in the second destruction it supplied eight thousand archers. \"And Avraham returned to his young men (Gen. 22:19) And where was Itzchak? Rabbi Berechiah said in the name of the Rabbis from there: he sent him to Shem to study Torah. This is similar to a woman who became wealthy through her spindle, she said: ‘Since I have become wealthy through this spindle, it will never leave my hand.’ So too Avraham said: ‘All that has happened to me is only because I engaged in Torah and mitzvot; so I do not want it to ever depart from my seed.’ Rabbi Chanina said: He sent him [home] at night, for fear of the [evil] eye, because from the moment that Chananiah, Mishael, and Azariah came out unscathed from the fiery furnace they aren't mentioned anymore, and where did they go? Rabbi Eleazar said: They died through the spittle. Rabbi Yosei said: They died through an [evil] eye. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: They changed their place and went to Yehoshua ben Yehotzadak to study Torah, since it is written \"Hear now, Yehoshua the high priest, you, and your companions that sit before you [for they are men that are a sign] (Zech. 3:8). Rabbi Chanina said: For this Chananiah, Mishael, and Azariah went down to the fiery furnace, that a sign should be done through them."

The chosen of the prophets is Moshe as it says (Psalms 106,23) \"Were it not for Moshe His chosen one\" and Hashem said to him \"For I will be with you\" and in the end he became frightened as it says (Numbers 21:34) \"And Hashem said to Moshe, don't fear him\" Hashem would only say \"Don't fear him\" to someone who has become afraid. Rabbi Brechiah and Rabbi Chelbo recited in the name of Rabbi Shmuel Bar Nachman who recited in the name of Rabbi Nassan \"The Jewish people were worthy of being destroyed in the days of Haman, were it not that they relied on the knowledge of the parents' elder. They said \"If Yaacov our patriarch, who was promised security by Hashem and Hashem told hi \"And behold I will be with you\" and HE became frigthened. How much moreso US. It is this that the prophet accuses Israel of and says to them (Isaiah 51,13) \"And you forgot Hashem your maker the one who spread the heavens and founded earth.\" He said to those people what he would say to you (Jeremiah 31,36) \"So said Hashem: If the heavens from above will be measured\" if you see that the heavens quake and that the earth quakes, from the inclination of the heavens and earth you wouldn't learn anything other than (Isaiah 51,13) \"And you are afraid all your days\""

Immediately, 'And he saw and he could not overcome him.' There is a parable of a king that had a wild dog and a tamed lion. And the king took his son and endeared him to the lion, [such that] if the dog would take him on, the king would say to him, 'The lion was not able to stand in front of him and you want to take him on?'

The generation of persecution (<i>shemad</i>). \"And he touched the hollow of Yakov's thigh\" - Rabbi Berachia and Rabbi Eliezer [disagreed about this]: Rabbi Eliezer said, \"He pressed it down.\" Rabbi Berachia said in the name of Rabbi Assi, \"He split it like a fish.\" Rabbi Nachman bar Yakov said, \"He separated it from its place, as it is written (Ezekiel 23:18), 'and my soul was separated etc... like my soul was separated' [in which the context shows that the verb for touching also means separating].\" Said Rabbi Chanina bar Yitschak, \"That whole night both of them were striking each other, the shield of this one across from the shield of that one.

It is written, \"No one rules over the wind to restrain the wind, and there is no ruling over the day of death\" (Eccles 8:8). Rabbi Yehoshua of Sichnin said in the name of Rabbi Levi: The trumpets which Moses made in the wilderness were hidden by the Holy One, who is blessed, when Moses neared death so that no one else would sound them while they were coming to him, as it is written, \"Gather to me all the elders of your tribes\" (Deut 31:28), in order to fulfill what is stated, \"And there is no ruling over the day of death\"....And so too when Jacob neared death he began to lower himself before Joseph and said to him, \"Please, if I have found favor in your eyes\" (Gen 47:29). When [did he say this]? As he was approaching death, as it is stated, \"And Israel drew near to the time of dying\" (ibid.).   "

            "2": "\"The angel who has redeemed me from all harm[...]\" (Genesis 48:16) Rabbi Yosei son of Chalafta said, sustenance is doubly difficult, like birth. Of birth it is written (Genesis 3:16) \"In pain [עצב] shall you bear children\", and of sustenance it is written (Genesis 3:17) \"By toil [עצבון] shall you eat of it [the ground] all the days of your life.\" Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shmuel son of Nachman, Rabbi Elazar said, redemption is deduced from sustenance and sustenance from redemption. Just as redemption is doubled, so too is sustenance doubled. Just as sustenance is daily, so too is sustenance daily. Rabbi Shmuel son of Nachman said, and [sustenance] is greater than redemption, for redemption comes at the hand of an angel and sustenance at the hand of the Holy Blessed One. Redemption by the hand of an angel, \"the angel who redeemed me\" (Genesis 48:16), and sustenance by the hand of the Holy Blessed One, \"open Your hand and satisfy all that lives\" (Psalms 145:16). Rabbi Yehoshua son of Levi said, the victuals of man are as difficult as the splitting of the Sea of Reeds, as it says \"to the One Who split the Sea of Reeds asunder\" (Psalms 136:13) and it is written later \"Who gives food to all flesh\" (Psalms 145:25). \"Bless the lads\" (Genesis 48:16), these are Yehoshua and Gidon, for there it says \"And it was when Yehoshua was in Yericho, and he lifted up his eyes and saw, and behold, a man stood over him... and he [the man] said 'No, but I am captain of the LORD's host and have just arrived...'\" (Joshua 5:13-14). Rabbi Yehoshua in the name of Rabbi Chanina son of Yitzchak, he cried out from within his toenails, as it says \"And he said, 'I am a captain of the LORD's host'\" (ibid.) - a captain of the Lofty Ones am I, and every place that I am seen, the Holy Blessed One is seen. This is a sign that in every place that Rabbi Yosei was set[?], so too Rabbi would appear. \"Now I have come\" (ibid.) -- with Moshe your teacher I have come, rather that he was praying and said \"Unless You go in the lead...\" (Exodus 33:15) - I was unable to ascend above, but now that I have not done my mission, I was not able to descend below, that now I pray and say \"Unless You go in the lead.\" Rather, be warned that you should not do as Moshe your teacher did with me, and I was swayed. \"And may they be teeming multitudes [וידגו לרב] on the earth...\" (Genesis 48:16). Just as the eye does not penetrate/rule over to see these fish [דגים], so your sons will not be seen/ruled over by the [evil] eye. So it is written, \"The sons of Yosef spoke to Yehoshua... [saying, 'Why have you assigned as our portion a single allotment and a single district, seeing that we are a numerous people...']\" (Joshua 17:14). He said to them, 'Are you not afraid of the [evil] eye?' [i.e. how can you boast of your numbers?]. They responded, 'This was our father's blessing for us, \"they shall be teeming multitudes on the earth\" (Genesis 48:16).' Just as these fish are only caught in the throat, so your sons will only be caught in the throat. \"And they said to him, please say 'shibolet,' and he said 'sibolet'.\" (Judges 12:6). Just as these fish grow in water, and when one drop descends from above they accept it with thirst like one who had never tasted water in their life, so too Israel grow in the water of Torah, and when they hear one new word of Torah they accept it with thirst as one who had never heard a word of Torah in their life. Rabbi Levi said, the women of Israel became impregnated with sixty thousand foetuses in one night, and all were sent to the Nile, and they ascended [out of the Nile?] in the merit of Moshe, since Moshe said \"Six hundred thousand are my feet of the people that I am within\" (Numbers 11:21) -- they all went up to my feet.

At the moment when the Holy One came to give the Torah on Sinai the mountains came running and arguing with each other. This one said ‘the Torah will be given on me!’ and this one said ‘the Torah will be given on me!’ Mount Tabor came from Bet Elim and  Mount Carmel from Espamia, this is what is written “As long as I live, says the King, Whose name is the Lord of Hosts, that as sure as Tabor is among the mountains, and Carmel is by the sea, it shall come about.” (Yimiyahu 46:18) This one said ‘I was called!’ and this one said ‘I was called!’ The Holy One said ‘Why do you lurk, you lofty mountains?’ You are all high mountains, but what does lofty (gavnunim) mean? As it says “…or one with long eyebrows (gibein), or a cataract…” (Vayikra 21:20) Idolatry was done on all of you, but Sinai upon which idolatry was never done “…the mountain that God desired for His dwelling,” (Tehillim 68:17) “The Lord descended upon Mount Sinai…” (Shemot 19:20) Nevertheless, “…Even the Lord will dwell [there] forever,” (Tehillim 68:17) refers to the eternal House. R’ Akiva explained the verse as referring to the tribes. At the moment when Shlomo said to build the Holy Temple, the tribes came running and arguing with each other. This one said ‘in my portion it will be built!’ This one said ‘in my portion it will be built!’ The Holy One said to them ‘tribes, why are you lurking? All of you are tribes, all of you are righteous – but lofty (gavnunim). What is gavnunim? Ganavim (thieves). You were all partners in the sale of Yosef; but Benyamin, who did not participate in the sale of Yosef, “…the mountain that God desired for His dwelling.” (Tehillim 68:17) So we find that four hundred and eighty years beforehand the children of Korach prophesied on this, that in the future it would be in the portion of Benyamin as it says “My soul yearns, yea, it pines for the courts of the Lord…” (Tehillim 84:3) So too it says “Behold we heard it in Ephrath…” (Tehillim 132:6) R’ Yehudah says ‘the Holy Temple was built in the portion of Yehudah, as it is written “…Ephrathite man from Bethlehem of Judah…”’ (Shmuel I 17:12) R’ Shimon says ‘in the portion of the son of she who died in Ephrathah. And who died in Ephrathah? Rachel. Perhaps it was in the portion of Yosef who is also among her sons? The verse says “…we found it in the fields of the forest.” (Tehillim 132:6) In the portion of the one who is compared to a beast of the forest, and who is so compared? Benyamin, as it is written “Benjamin is a wolf, he will prey…” (Bereshit 49:27)",
