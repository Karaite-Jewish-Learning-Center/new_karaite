As regarding Moses, only the men wept for him, but regarding Aaron, the men and the women wept for him - since he was one that pursued peace and loved peace, and restored peace between a man and his wife, and between a man and his fellow. This is [the meaning of] that which is written (Malachi 2:6), \"He walked with Me in peace and justice, and brought many back from iniquity.\" And what did Aaron do? When he heard that two men or a man and his wife were arguing, he would go to one of them and say to him, \"Your fellow came to me and is distraught in his heart that he angered you; so he cajoled me that I should come to you [and get your forbearance], so that he [can] come to you and be forgiven by you.\" And Aaron would not leave from there until he would remove all the hatred in his heart and bring peace between them. Then he would leave. And when he (the one with which Aaron had spoken) met his fellow, they would immediately love and embrace each other and kiss each other. And so was it during all the days of Aaron, peace be upon him; and such was his trait. When he heard that there was an argument between a man and his wife, he would not leave them until they made peace. Hence the men and the women wept for Aaron, but only the males wept for our teacher Moses, peace be upon him. And also [because] Moses would say, \"Let justice pierce the mountain,\" whereas Aaron would bring a compromise between two litigants."
