            "1": "\"Go and observe the ant lazybones!\" (Proverbs 6:6). Rabbi Yehudah ben Padyah says: The wicked will one day come before the Holy One and say: \"Master of the World, let us rest and we will make teshuvah before you.\" The Holy One responded to them: \"idiots of the world, the world that you see yourselves in is like living on erev Shabbat, whereas the world as it is on Shabbat. If you don't prepare for Shabbat on erev Shabbat, what will you eat? Another example might be that the world in which you see yourselves is like being on dry land, whereas the world as it is already  is immersed in the sea. What are you going to eat when you're at sea if you haven't prepared when you had time on the land? Another example might be that the world in which you see yourselves is like an entrance way to a home, whereas the world as it is already exists within the living room. If a person doesn't prepare to unlock the door, how will he enjoy the comforts of home? Another example might be that the world in which you see yourselves is like a warm sunny day, whereas the world as it is experiences a downpour of rain. If you haven't sowed,  reaped, or harvested your field when it was sunny and warm, how will you sustain yourself when it rains?"

Another [understanding] - <b>Wisdoms have built her house:</b> The Holy One, blessed be He said, \"If a man merits and studies Torah and wisdom, he is considered in front of Me as if he stood up entirely all of the world; <b>it hewed out pillars seven</b> these are seven lands - if a man merits and sustains it, he inherits seven lands, and if not, he is divided among seven lands. <b>She prepared her meat, she mingled her wine (Proverbs 9:2):</b> Rabbi Abahu said, \"This is Esther the Queen, as at the time that trouble came to Israel in the days of Mordekhai, what did she do? She set up a meal for Achashverosh and Haman the evildoer and she got him very drunk with wine, and the evildoer thought to himself that she was granting him honor and he did not know that she opened a trap for him - from that which she got him drunk with wine, she acquired her people forever; <b>she even prepared her table</b> that she set herself up a table in this world and in the world to come. And what is that? That is the good name that she acquired in this world and in the world to come; since all of the holidays are to be nullified in the future but the days of Purim will not be nullified, as it is stated (Esther 9:28), 'And these days of Purim will not be rescinded from the Jews.'\" Rabbi Elazar said, \"Also Yom Kippur will forever not be nullified, as it is stated, 'And it will be to you for an everlasting statute to atone for the Children of Israel from all of their sins once a year.'\" Another [understanding]: <b>she even prepared her table:</b> This is the Torah, that sets up a table for one who is involved with it, in this world and in the next world, as it is stated (Ezekiel 41:22), \"and He spoke to me, 'This is the table that is in front of the Lord.'\" Another [understanding]: <b>she even prepared her table:</b> It once happened that Rabbi Akiva was imprisoned in jail and Rabbi Yehoshua the Garsi, his student, was serving him. [On] the eve of the holiday, [the latter] departed from him and went to his house. Eliyahu came and stood at the entrance of his house. He said to him, \"Peace be unto you, my teacher.\" He said [back] to him, \"Peace be unto you, my teacher and master.\" He said to him, \"Is there nothing that you require? He said to him, \"I am a priest and I have come to tell you that Rabbi Akiva has died in jail.\" Immediately they both went to the jail and found the opening of the gate of the jail open and the minister of the jail was sleeping and all of the people that were in the jail were [also] sleeping; and they lay Rabbi Akiva on the bed and went out [with him]. Immediately Eliyahu, may he be remembered for the good, attended to him and took him on his shoulders. And when Rabbi Yehoshua the Garsi saw this, he said to Eliyahu, \"My teacher, did you not say to me, I am Eliyahu [the] priest, and a priest is forbidden to become impure through [contact with a dead [body]!\" He said [back] to him, \"It is enough for you, Rabbi Yehoshua, my son, God forbid - as there is no impurity from the righteous, and also not from their students.\" And they carried him the whole night until they reached the mansion house of Caesarea. And when they reached there, they went up three steps and went down inclines and a cave opened in front of them and there they saw a chair and a bench and a candelabra. And they laid down Rabbi Akiva on the bed and left. And when they went out, the cave sealed and the lamp on the candelabra became lit. And when Eliyahu saw this, he opened and said, \"Happy are the righteous and happy are those that toil in the Torah and happy are those that fear God - as covered and hidden and reserved for you is a place in the Garden of Eden in the future to come. Happy are you Rabbi Akiva, that you should find a resting place prepared for you at the time of your death. That is why it is stated, 'she even prepared her table.'\" And it also once happened with Rabban Gamliel, that the elders were reclining [to eat] with him and Tabi, his servant, was standing to serve him. Rabbi Elazar ben Azariya said, \"Woe is to you Canaan that you obligated your children [to servitude], whether they be righteous or whether they be evil.\" Rabbi Yishmael said, \"We have found greater than this - Avraham was the great one of the world who served the Canaanites.\" Rabbi Tarfon said, \"We have found greater than this -  the High priest serves Israel on Yom Kippur.\" Rabban Gamliel said to them, \"You have left over the honor of the Holy One, blessed be He, and you are dealing with the honor of flesh and blood? The Holy One, blessed be He, created His world, makes the wind blow, makes the sun shine, brings down the rain, makes the due appear, makes the plants grow and sets up a table in front of each and every [person], as it is written, (Psalms 23:5), 'Set a table in front of me.' And why [does He do] so much? In the merit of Torah. Therefore Shlomo prophesied and said, 'she even prepared her table.'\" Rabbi Nechemiah said, \"Come and see how great is the honor of Torah: It is not enough for them, for the sages, that He prepares a table for them, but it [even] adds wisdom to their wisdom. This is what is written (Proverbs 9:9), 'Give to a wise man, and he will become even wiser; inform a righteous one, and he will increase in teaching' - If you see a Torah scholar for whom words of Torah are beloved, give him wisdom and he will become even wiser; 'inform a righteous one, and he will increase in teaching' - that since he destroys his soul to hear words of Torah, it also adds fear [of God] to him.\""

            "0": "...Rabbi Ishmael said, the same night that Solomon had completed the Temple, he married the daughter of Pharoah and there was a great celebration in the Temple. And the celebration of the Daughter of Pharaoh rose above the celebration of the Temple. As it is said, “That it is always so that people flatter the king”. In that moment God thought of destroying it [the Temple] as it says (Jeremiah 32:31) “The city has aroused My anger and My wrath from the day it was built until this day; so it must be removed from My sight.” And Rabbi Levi said, regarding the Morning Sacrifice that was coming close to the fourth hour. What did the Daughter of Pharoah do? She made a certain sheet [and placed it above his bed], and placed on it stars and planets, and every time that Solomon would try to wake up, he would see these stars and planets and would return to sleep for another four hours. Rabbi Levi said, on that day the Morning Sacrifice came close to being sacrificed in the fourth hour. [and regarding that hour it was taught: there was a situation in which the Morning Tamid was sacrificed in the fourth hour nad the people of Israel were saddened, for it was the day of the Inaugration of the Temple and they could not carry out the sacrifice because Solomon was asleep, and they were afraid of waking him because of the fear of the Kingship. They went and told Bat-Sheva his mother, and she went and woke him up and rebuked him, as it is written, “rebuke that his mother rebuked him”  ...",
            "1": "<b>\"A valiant woman, who can find\" (Proverbs 31:10):</b> That is the Torah; \"and further than pearls (<i>peninim</i>) is her price\" - as it was 'in front of Me and inside (<i>lefanim</i>)' and Moshe merited to bring it down to earth. \"Her husband puts his confidence in her, and lacks no 'booty'\" - that there is nothing lacking in it. Another explanation: \"A valiant woman, who can find\" - They said, \"There was a story about Rabbi Meir who was sitting and expounding in the study hall on Shabbat afternoon, when two of his sons died. What did his mother do? She placed both of them on the bed and spread a sheet over them. At the end of Shabbat, Rabbi Meir came home from the study hall. He said to her, 'Where are my two sons?' She said [back], 'They went to the study hall.' He said to her, 'I scanned the study hall and I did not see them.' They gave him the cup of Havdalah and he separated [the days of the week with the closure of Shabbat]. He repeated and said, 'Where are my two sons?' She said, 'They went elsewhere and they are coming now.' She placed food in front of him and he ate and blessed. After he blessed, she said to him, 'I have a question to ask you.' He said to her, 'Say your question.' She said to him, 'Rabbi, before today, a man came and deposited something with me, and now he is coming to take it. Should we return it to him or not?' He said, 'My daughter, one who has a deposit with him must return it to its owner.' She said to him, 'Were it not for your consent, I would not have given it to him.' What did she do? She grabbed his hand, brought him up to that room, had him approach the bed and took off the sheet from upon them. When he saw both of them dead and laying upon the bed, he began to cry and say, 'My sons, my sons, my teachers, my teachers - my sons in the way of the world, my teachers in that they would enlighten my eyes with their Torah.' At that time, she said to Rabbi Meir, 'Rabbi, is this not what I told you - do I not need to return the deposit to its Owner?' He said, '\"The Lord has given and the Lord has taken; may the name of the Lord be blessed\"' (Job 1:21).\" Rabbi Chanina said, \"With this thing, she consoled him and his mind became composed - that is is why it states, 'A valiant woman, who can find.'\" Rabbi Chama bar Chanina said, \"On account of what did the sons of Rabbi Meir become liable and die at one time? Because they were accustomed to leaving the study hall to sit with food and drink.\" Rabbi Yochanan said, \"Even with trifling matters - as when the Torah was given to Israel, he only warned them about the words of Torah, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 26:16), 'This day the Lord, your God, commands you to do.'\" ",
            "4": "<b>Many women have done well (Proverbs 31:29):</b> Adam, the first man, was commanded about six commandments. Noach [was additionally commanded] about [not eating] a limb from a live animal. Avraham about circumcision. Yitschak was educated with [these] eight [commandments]. Yaakov [was additionally commanded] about [not eating] the sciatic nerve. Yehudah about levirate marriage. [The people of] Israel about two hundred and forty-eight positive commandments corresponding to the two hundred and forty-eight limbs in a man - each and every limb says to man, \"I plead of you to do this commandment with me\" - and three hundred and sixty-five negative commandments corresponding to the three hundred and sixty-five days of the solar [year] - and each and every day says to man, \"I plead of you not to do this sin on me.\" \"Grace is false, beauty is illusory\" (Proverbs 31:30) - the grace of Noach was false, as it states (Genesis 6:8), \"But Noach found grace in the eyes of the Lord.\" Rabbi Levi said, \"Only in his generation [did he find grace].\" \"Beauty is illusory\" - illusory was the beauty of Adam, the first man. Rabbi Shimon ben Manassia said, \"The ball of Adam, the first man's heel would dim the sun. And do not wonder - it is customary in the world that when a man makes two salver vessels, one for himself and one for his household, which does he make [nicer], is it not his? So [too], Adam, the first man, was created to serve in front of the Holy One, blessed be He; and the sun was created to make light for the creatures. And if the ball of his heel was such,  the contour of his face, all the more so.\" \"A woman that has fear of the Lord, she is to be praised\" - this is Moshe. \"Give of the fruit of her hand\" (Proverbs 31:30) - Rabbi Yose bar Yirmiyah said, \"Why did he compare the prophets to women? Rather, just like [a] woman is not embarrassed to claim the needs of the home from her husband, so [too] were the prophets not embarrassed to claim the needs of Israel from in front of the Holy One, blessed be He.\" The Holy One blessed be He said, \"My sons, be involved in Torah [study] day and night, and I will count it for you as if you hold up the heavens and the earth,\" as it states (Joshua 1:8), \"Let not this book of the Torah cease from your mouth, but meditate upon it day and night\"; and it states (Joshua 1:9), “Did I not command you, 'Be strong and resolute; do not be terrified or dismayed'\"; and it states (Ezra 3:11), \"with praise and thanks to the Lord, for He is good, for His kindness upon Israel is forever, and the people raised a great shout with praise to the Lord, for the foundation of the House of the Lord had been laid\"; (Proverbs 23:23) \"Acquire truth\"; (Proverbs 5:17) \"They will be yours alone\"; (Proverbs 9:9) \"Give to a wise man, and he will grow wiser\"; (Proverbs 9:11) \"For through me your days will increase, and years of life be added.\" Another interpretation: \"A woman of valor who can find?\" - this is [the meaning] of what the verse states (Psalms 92:15), \"In old age they still produce fruit, etc.\" - corresponding to Avraham and Sarah who were of the same measure concerning charity and acts of kindness; they were a good sign for the world. In this way, He does not prevent proper women from the righteous ones, [but] matches them. As so [too] do we find with the wife of Noach that her actions and his actions were of the same measure - that is why she merited with him and was rescued from the waters of the flood. \"Her husband puts his confidence in her\" - this is Sarah, our mother, as Avaraham grew rich on her account, as it states (Genesis 12:16), \"And he benefited Avraham for her sake.\" \"She bestows good to him, and not bad\" - this is Rivkah, our mother, who bestowed [good] to Yitzchak at the time that Sarah, his mother died. \"She seeks wool and flax\" - this is Leah, our mother, who received Yaakov with a pleasant countenance, as it is written (Genesis 30:16), \"And Yaakov came  from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him and said, 'You are to sleep with me, for I have hired you, etc.'\" Therefore she merited and kings and prophets came from her. \"She is like a merchant fleet\" - this is Rachel, our mother, who was embarrassed about [her lack of] children every day. Therefore she merited and a son came from her who was similar to a ship that is filled will all the good [found] in the world - so [was it with] Yosef, that the whole world survived from his merit and he supported the world in the years of famine. \"She rises while it is still night\" - this is Batya, the daughter of Pharaoh. She was a gentile and became a Jewess and they mentioned her name among the proper [women], since she took care of Moshe. Therefore she merited and entered the Garden of Eden in her lifetime. \"She sets her mind on a field and acquires it; [she plants a vineyard from the produce of her hand]\" - this is Yocheved, that from her came Moshe who is equivalent to all of Israel, which is called a vineyard, as it states (Isaiah 5:7), \"For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the House of Israel.\" \"She girds her loins with strength\" - this is Miriam, as before Moshe was born, she said, \"In the future, my mother will give birth to the savior of Israel.\" Once he was born and the yoke upon them became heavier, her father got up and bopped her on the head. He said to her, \"Where is your prophecy?\" And he got up and spit in front of her face. And nonetheless, she exerted herself about her prophecy, as it is written (Exodus 2:4), \"And his sister stood from a distance.\" \"She advises (<i>taamah</i>) that her merchandise is good; [her lamp never goes out at night]\" - this is Channah who tasted (<i>taamah</i>) the taste of prayer, as it states (I Samuel 2:1), \"And Hannah prayed, 'My heart exults in the Lord, etc.'\" Therefore she merited and a son came from her that was the match of Moshe and Aharon, which would bring light to Israel like lamps, as it is written (Psalms 99:6), \"Moshe and Aharon among his priests, and Shmuel among the ones that call His name.\" And it is written about Shmuel (I Samuel 3:3), \"The lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Shmuel was sleeping in the temple of the Lord.\" \"She sets her hand to the distaff\" - this is Yael, who did not kill Sisera with a weapon, but rather with a peg through the force of her hands. And because of what did she not kill him with a weapon? In order to fulfill that which it states (Deuteronomy 22:5), \"There shall not be the vessel of a man on a woman.\" \"Her palm she spreads out to the poor\" - this is the widowed woman of Tsarfat, who supported Eliyahu with bread and water. \"She is not worried for her home because of snow, for her whole home is dressed in crimson\" - this is Rachav the prostitute. When Israel came to destroy Yericho, she did not fear from them, because they give her a sign - (Joshua 2:18) \"this line of scarlet string.\" \"She makes covers for herself; [her clothing is linen and purple]\" - this is Batsheva, that from her came Shlomo, who was adorned with linen and purple and ruled from [one] end of the world to the [other] end. \"Her husband is known in the gates,\" - this is Michal, who saved David from death. \"She makes cloth and sells it\" - this is the mother of Shimshon, that  through him Israel was saved. \"Strength and splendor are her clothing; [and she laughs to the last day]\" - this is Elisheva, the daughter of Aminadav, who saw four joyful events in one day: her brother [became] a prince; her husband, high priest; the brother of her husband, king; and her two children, young priests. \"She opens her mouth with wisdom\" - this is the wise woman who said (II Samuel 20:16), “Listen, listen! Please tell Yoav, 'Come over here and I will speak to you,'” who saved the city with her wisdom; and this was Sarach the daughter of Asher. \"She oversees the activities of her household\" - this is the wife of Ovadiah, who rescued her sons and they did not worship idolatry with Achav. \"Her children rise and declare her happy\" - this is the Shunamite, who is called a great woman (II Kings 4:8). And because of what? Because she pressed upon Elisha to eat. “Many women have done well, but you surpass them all” - this is Ruth the Moabitess, who came under the wings of the Divine presence. \"Grace is false, beauty is illusory\" - as she left her mother and her forefathers and her wealth, and came with her mother-in-law and accepted all of the commandments: the domain of Shabbat - \"to where you will walk, I will walk\" (Ruth 1:16); the prohibition of isolation with a man - \"and in that which you will lay, I will lay\"; the six hundred and thirteen commandments - \"your people is my people\"; idolatry - \"your God is my God\"; the four death penalties of the court - \"and in that which you will die, I will die\"; \"and there will I be buried\" - these are the two graveyards arranged for the court, one for the stoned and the burned, and one for the killed and the strangled. Therefore, she merited and David came from her, who gave pleasure with songs and praises to the Holy One, blessed be He. Therefore it is stated, \"Give of the fruit of her hand and let her works praise her in the gates.\" Be strong in ethical behavior, keep the Torah, and be rescued from the evil inclination."
