[The child] is deliberately asking this way, meaning  [What is this work] for you and not for him[self]. He is one of the four sons that the Torah spoke about, one wise, one wicked, one simple, and one who does not know to ask. This [verse] is the wicked one who removes himself from the collective and denies his creator:"

It was taught saying \"on that day\". If it must be on that day, I would learn [you] should begin [teaching] from the start of the day. It was taught saying \"because of this\" At the time when unleavened bread and bitter herbs are placed before you on your table. Lift them and say to [your son] \"Because of this\":",
                    "2": "\"The Lord did for me\". Why is this said? Because the wicked asks what is this work for you? and since he takes himself out of the collective [by saying 'for you'] and he did not definitely say heresy, accordingly you take him out of the collective [but don't call him a heretic]. And say to him, \"Because of this the Lord did for me\" and not for you. For if you were [in Egypt] you would not have been freed. Meaning you would have already died in the three days of total darkness. (see Mekhilta 12:25)"
