When God wished to create man he consulted the angels as it says (Genesis 1:26) \"Let Us make man.\" They began to say \"What is man that you recall him?!\" [God] replied \" Tomorrow you'll see how smart he is.\" When He created man what did God do? He brought all animals before the angels and asked them the names of all the animals and they did not know. God said to them \"Do you want to know the wisdom of Man? I will ask him and he will tell me what all their names.\" What did God do? He brought all the animals and birds before Adam as it says (ibid. 2:19) \"And the LORD formed from the earth.\" Rabbi Acha said, Did it not already say (ibid. 1:25) \"And God made the beasts of the land?\" What does the word \"and He formed\" come to teach us?

(Genesis 2:19) \"And He came to Adam to see what to call them\" Isn't God omniscient? Rather \"to see\" means \"to show the angels Adam's wisdom [by showing what Adam would call them],\" and Adam independently came up with the same name as God for each and every animal. Then God asked him, \"And you, what is your name?\" He replied, \"it is appropriate to call me Adam because I was created from the earth (Adamah).\" God asked, \"And what's My name?\" Adam replied \"It is appropriate to call you the LORD because you are the Lord of the entire world.\" That is why He says (Isaiah 42:8) \"I am the LORD, this is My name.\""

Is it not the rich one?  However, here (ibid) \"He has not hidden his face from me.\" Rabbi Haggai decreed a fast and the rain came down.  He said, “It is not because I am worthy, but 'because he neither scorned nor despised the poverty of the poor (ibid).'”  Just as “He neither scorned nor despised” the prayer of the poor, so too, “he neither scorned nor despised” their sacrifice. King Agripas, wanted to offer a thousand sacrifices in a single day. He sent a message to the Kohen Gadol, and said “do not let anyone offer sacrifices today except for me.”  One man came, and in his hands were two turtledoves.  He said to the Kohen, “Sacrifice these for me.”  The Kohen said to him, “The King has commanded me not to let anyone but him sacrifice today.”   He said to the priest “My lord, Kohen, I trap four turtledoves every day: two for a sacrifice and two to live on.  If you don't sacrifice them for me, you are cutting off my livelihood.” The priest arose and sacrificed them. Immediately King Agripas saw in a dream, “The sacrifice of a poor man came before yours.”  King Agripas sent to the Kohen Gadol, and said to him “Didn't I tell you not to let anyone but me sacrifice?” He said to him, “A poor man came to me and in his hands were two turtledoves, and he said to me 'Sacrifice these for me.'  I told him 'The King has commanded me not to let anyone sacrifice today except for him.'  He said to me 'My lord, Kohen, I trap four turtledoves every day: two for a sacrifice and two to live on.  If you don't sacrifice them for me, you are cutting off my livelihood.'  Even in this case, should I not have sacrificed?”  The King said to him, “You did beautifully. Behold: 'Because He neither scorned nor despised the poverty of the poor (Ibid.).'” It happened that they were leading an ox for sacrifice and it wouldn't go.  A poor man came long and he had a single bunch of vegetables in his hand, and he extended it to the ox, and it ate it and was led after him.  It appeared to the owner of the ox in a dream: “the bunch of vegetables that that poor man gave to the ox is more than your sacrifice.” It happened that a woman brought a handful of fine flour and the kohen scorned her, and said “Look what she is sacrificing!  It's too cheap to sacrifice! It's too cheap to burn on the altar!”  It appeared to the kohen in a dream “Do not scorn her!  It's as if she sacrificed her life.”  We can make a logical inference: since, in regard someone who doesn't sacrifice their life (nefesh), the Torah says “When a person (nefesh) brings a meal offering (Vayikra 2:1),” someone who actually sacrifices their life, all the more so. It once happened that a pious man who had brought his sacrifice from Gaul and from Spain, and he saw that the Kohen Gadol was taking out a palm full and turning it to smoke, and eating the rest.  He said “Did I go to all this trouble in order for this one to eat?!” Everyone appeased him saying “Just as this one was only troubled from the ramp to the altar, and yet he is rewarded that he will eat your gift. You, who troubled yourself with all this trouble, even more so!” This is the meaning of “Because He neither scorned nor despised (Ibid).”"

It was five cubits long and two and a half cubits wide, while the ark was one and a half cubits long, one and a half wide and one and a half tall.

Why did Shlomo suffer all of this? Because he was filled with pride and said “I have surely built You a house to dwell in…” (Melachim I 8:13) Since all of Israel saw this, they immediately said ‘it is certain that the Holy One has given atonement for that sin of David.’ Immediately their expression turned black like the bottom of a pot and they were ashamed.

Since it was destroyed He prays ‘may it be willed from before Me that my children repent that I bring nearer the building of My house and sanctuary, this is ‘His tabernacle was in Shalem.’ You find that the Temple is called Shalem as it says, “Malchitzedek king of Shalem” (Bereshit 14:18) and he is Shem the son of Noach as it says “and he was a priest to the Most High Gd” (ibid.)

This is no other than the house of Gd…” (Bereshit 28:17) From here they said that anyone who prays in Jerusalem is as if they pray before the Throne of Glory, because the gate of heaven is there; and an open door to hear prayer, as it says “…and this is the gate of heaven. (ibid.) Yaakov went back to gather the stones and he found that they were one stone. Yaakov took the stone and placed it as a monument in the midst of the place and oil descended from heaven for him and he pour it out on the stone, as it says “…and he poured oil on top of it.” (Bereshit 28:18) What did the Holy One do? He took its right foot, sank it to the deepest depths and made it a keystone for the earth, like a man who places a keystone in an arch. Therefore it is called foundation stone, because there is the navel of the world and from there the world was opened out. And upon it is the palace of Gd, as it says “And this stone, which I have placed as a monument, shall be a house of God…” (Bereshit 28:22) And Yaakov fell to the ground before the foundation stone, praying before the Holy One, and said ‘Master of the World! If you bring me back to this place in peace, then I will sacrifice before you whole offerings and thanksgiving offerings!’ as it says, “And Jacob uttered a vow, saying…” (Bereshit 28:20) He vowed and he fulfilled his vow. From there he picked up his feet (to go) and there he left the well, because the well had been going before him, and in the blink of an eye came to Haran as it says, [“Now Jacob lifted his feet…” (Bereshit 29:10)] “And Jacob left Be’er Sheva, and he went to Haran.” (Bereshit 28:10) About him the tradition says, “When you walk, your step will not be constrained, and if you run, you will not stumble.” (Mishle 4:12) R’ Abahu said in the name of R’ Yochanan – the angels carried him as it says, “On [their] hands they will bear you…” (Tehillim 91:12) Ya’akov’s steps were not constrained and his strength did not falter and like a mighty man he rolled back the stone from off of the mouth of the well. Then the well rose up and overflowed and the shepherds were astounded because all together they were unable to roll off the stone and he did it alone as it says, “…that Jacob drew near and rolled the rock off…” (Bereshit 29:10)"

From there He took him and to there He returned him to the place from which he was taken, as it says “Now the Lord God took the man…” (Bereshit 2:15) From where did He take him? From the place of the Holy Temple, and he settled outside of the Garden of Eden on Mount Moriah, as it says “…to till the soil, whence he had been taken.” (Bereshit 3:23)…"

            "7": "\"Egypt rejoiced at their departure\" (Psalms 105:38) Rabbi Berchiah said: this can be compared to a corpulent man that was riding on a donkey. The donkey hopes, \"When will he get down from me?!\" and [the man] himself hopes, \"When will I get off the donkey?!\". When he gets down, the man rejoiced and the donkey rejoices. But I don't know who is happier. Such was it when Israel was in Egypt. The plagues were coming on the Egyptians and the Egyptians were hoping, \"When will Israel go out?!\" And Israel was hoping, \"When will the Holy One Blessed Be He redeem us?\" When they were redeemed, both these and these were happy, but we don't know who was happier. From what David said: \"Egypt rejoiced at their departure\", we know that Egypt was happier."

            "0": "o\t“Of David. A psalm. The LORD said to my lord, “Sit at My right hand…” This is what the verse says “Who awakened one from the east whom righteousness met wherever he set his foot?” (Isaiah 41:2) The nations of the world we as if asleep, failing to take shelter beneath the wings of the Divine presence. Who awakened them to come and take shelter? Avraham, as it says: Who awakened one from the east. And not only the nations, but even righteousness itself was sleeping until Avraham awakened it. How did Avraham do this? He made an inn and opened doors in every direction in order to receive all those passing by, as it says “He planted a tamarisk (eshel) at Beer-sheba…” (Genesis 21:33) R’ Azaria said: what is this eshel (אשל)? It is an acronym for eating (אכילה), drinking (שתייה) and escorting one’s guests (לוייה). This is “righteousness met wherever he set his foot…”"

Sin offerings and guilt offerings atone only for that [particular] transgression, as it is said: \"that it may be pleasing (nirtzah) in his behalf, to atone for him.\" (Lev. 1:4) But chastisements atone for all [sins]. That is, H' has chastised me greatly [for all my sins, so my atonement is complete].",

They say to him: Th[ere] is the gate of one who feeds the hungry; enter it. Another says: I gave water to the thirsty; and they say to him: Th[ere] is the gate of one who gives water to the thirsty; enter it. And the same for one who clothes the naked, and one who raises orphans and one who is charitable; and so with all the mitzvot. David said: I did all of the[se things]; open all of them for me. Therefore he says: Open for me the gates of righteousness so that I may enter them."
