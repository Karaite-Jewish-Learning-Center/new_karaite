Even though it says at the end of Tractate Horayot (Horayot 3:8) that a learned <i>mamzer</i> precedes an ignoramus high priest. As it says (Proverbs 3:15) \"She [wisdom] is more precious than rubies\", from a high priest who enters within and beyond. Nonetheless, the holiness of Jerusalem is unable to bear him, since its holiness is very great -- one who does not have proper lineage, such as a <i>mamzer</i>, would not be able to have settlement in Jerusalem. And so it is written \"And a <i>mamzer</i> shall dwell in Ashdod, etc.\" (Zechariah 9:6). Commentated."
