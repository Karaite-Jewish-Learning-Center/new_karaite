            "1": "A child may go on nursing for twenty-four months, and from that time forward, he is like one who nurses from a non-kosher animal--these are the words of Rabbi Eliezer. Rabbi Yehoshua says: a child may go on nursing even until he is a child of five years, but if he ceased and then returned (to nursing) after twenty-four months, behold he is like one who nurses from a non-kosher animal.",
            "2": "A woman is obligated to nurse her child for twenty-four months, whether her own or one who was given to her to wet-nurse. The woman given a child to wet-nurse should not do with him work and should not nurse another child with him. A child who recognizes his mother, they do not give him to nurse from someone else because of the danger to life. A child may nurse from an idol worshiper or from an unclean animal--he can nurse from anything, even on shabbat. But if he was an adult, it is prohibited. Abba Shaul says: we used to suckle from a clean animal on a holiday."
