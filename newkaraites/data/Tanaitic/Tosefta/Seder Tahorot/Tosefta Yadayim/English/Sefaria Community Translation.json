            "6": "Amon and Moabâ€”they tithe poor tithe in the seventh year. And in all lands on other years of the seven-year cycle: if [they do] poor tithe, poor tithe; if second tithe, second tithe. Said Rabbi Yose ben Durmaskit: I was with the early elders when they came from Yavneh to Lod and I found Rabbi Eliezer sitting in the baker's shop in Lod. He said to me: What new learning do you have in the study house today? I said to him: We are your students and we drink from your waters! He said to me: It is impossible there was no new learning! I told him the laws, the answers and everything. But when I came to this, his eyes flowed with tears. He said, \"God's secret is for those who fear Him and He makes known His covenant to them\" (Psalms 25:14); and it says, \"Does the Lord God do anything without revealing His secret to His servants the prophets?\" (Amos 3:7). Go and say to them: Do not pay attention to your number [i.e. the court]! Thus I received from Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai, he received it from the Pairs, and the Pairs from the prophets, from Moses, a law from Sinai, that Amon and Moab they tithe the poor tithe in the seventh year!
