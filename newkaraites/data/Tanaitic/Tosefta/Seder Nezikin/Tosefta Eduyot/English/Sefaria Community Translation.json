And they upheld their words. Why did they mention their place of origin and their profession? Because you cannot find a more lowly profession than a weaver, nor a lowlier place than the Dung Gate. But just as the Fathers of the World would not stand on their words on the basis of rumor, how much more so one (today) should not stand on his words on the basis of rumor. The law is always in accordance with the majority; the only reason the words of a single dissenting voice are mentioned among the majority is in case they are needed in a given hour and can be relied upon. The Sages say, \"The only reason the words of a single dissenting voice are mentioned among the majority is that from one person ruling 'Pure!' and another ruling 'Impure, as Rabbi Eliezer said!', they can then say to him, 'Have you really heard this in the name of Rabbi Eliezer?'\" ",

If there were two, and one prohibited and the other permitted, one rendered it pure and the other impure -- if there is another Master, we ask him. If not, we follow the stricter ruling. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korha says, \"In teachings of Scripture, we follow the stricter opinion. In teachings of the Scribes, we follow the more lenient opinion.\""

The rim of a stone strainer—Rabbi Eliezer says: It is not impure in the air; but the Sages say: It is impure in the air. A baker's sheet which is fixed to a nail, or attached to a beam—Rabbi Eliezer makes it pure; but the Sages make it impure. A shoe that is on the shoe mold—Rabbi Eliezer makes it pure; but the Sages make it impure. He cut it [an oven, see Mishnah Kelim 5:10] into rings, and sand is placed between each ring, Rabbi Eliezer makes it pure; but the Sages make it impure. This was called the oven of Akhnai, for on its account, disagreement (mahloket) increased in Israel.",

One who wishes to be strict upon oneself and to follow the strictures of both Beth Hillel and Beth Shammai, regarding this person it is said “the fool walks in darkness” (Ecclesiastes 2:14), while one who accepts the leniencies of Beth Shamai and the leniencies of Beth Hillel is evil – [one must follow] either Beth Shammai in accordance with their leniencies and strictures, or Beth Hillel in accordance with their leniencies and strictures."
