These refer to their festivals that have fixed dates. But if they are fixed, it is only forbidden [to do business] on that day. Although they [the anonymous rabbis] said, \"Three days it is forbidden to sell or to buy with them.\" What do these words refer to? To a matter [of business] that is finished, but to a matter that is not yet fulfilled, it is permitted [to do business]. Even a matter that is finished regarding buying or selling is permitted. R. Yehoshua ben Qarchah says, \"Every lender with a document [guaranteeing a loan] may not be repaid by them [the idolaters on a festival day], and the one without a document may be repaid by them because it is like a protector from their hand.\" ",
            "1": "2. Let him not not buy or sell with an idolater on the day of his festival. Let him not \"lighten his head\" with him [through drink?]. Let him not greet him in a place that is thought to have idolatry[?], for greeting someone is tantamount to honoring him. Let them greet idolaters on their festival days for the sake of peace. Jewish artisans who work besides an idolater in a Jewish home, it is permitted [to greet them], but in an idolater's home it is forbidden. R. Shimon b. Elazar says, \"If he was a hired worker for the day, whether he worked in the home of a Jew or an idolater, it is forbidden [to greet an idolater]. If he was a hired worker under a Jewish home, it is permitted, but in an idolater's  home, it is forbidden. If he is working in a fixed place[?], whether it is in the home of a Jew or an idolater, it is forbidden. In another city, either way it is permitted [to greet]. And although he finished making an idolater's tool before the idolater's festival day, he may not bring it to him because his home would rejoice.\" One city does [idolatry?] and another city does not, one nation does and another does not, one family does and another does not. The ones who do are forbidden and the one who do not are permitted. Calends. Though everyone does [idolatry?], only the worshipers are forbidden. Saturnalia. The day in which he seized control, Krateisis. The Day of Genusia [Birthday] of the kings of the idolaters is the day of each king and the day in which he like the rabble. An individual, even the day of his banquet and the day in which in which he took control. R. Meir says, \"Even the day in which he was sick, it is forbidden [to do business].\"",
            "2": "One may not go to a [idolatrous] market-place that is in a village or in any of the surrounding cities because it looks like he is going to the market-places in those cities. These are the words of R. Meir. The sages say, \"Only that village is forbidden. A market-place that is inside of a village is forbidden. If it is outside of the village, it is permitted. As for the nobility [?] of a village, it is forbidden to deal with them outside the village, but it is permitted inside the village. The shops that are crowned at each place are forbidden. If a man is in a caravan going from place to place and enters a village in which there is a market-place, let him not worry because it looks like he goes into an market-place. A market-place that was given by the kingdom, the state, or by the elite of the state are permitted. Only the market-place of idolaters is forbidden.   "

They give possession of an animal to their shepherd, and they give over their child to teach him book(s) and to teach him art and to be alone with him. A daughter of Israel (may) act as a midwife or a wet-nurse for a Samaritan woman and a Samaritan (woman may) act as a midwife or a wet-nurse for an Israelite woman. They do not put up an animal in inns of idol worshipers, not even males in the places of males or females in the places of females, as a male will have sexual relations with a male and a female will have sexual relations with a female, and it is unnecessary to say males in the places of females and females in the places of males. And they do not give possession of an animal to their shepherd, nor a child to teach him book(s) or to teach him art or to be alone with him. A daughter of Israel may not be a wet-nurse for the an idol worshiper because she raise him for idol worship; but an idol worshiper may act as a wet-nurse for an Israelite woman in her domain. A daughter of Israel may not act as a midwife for an idol worshiper because she delivers (the child) for idol worship. An idol worshiper may not act as a midwife for a daughter of Israel, because they suspect (idol worshipers) of (taking) lives, (these are) the words of Rabbi Meir. But the Sages say that an idol worshiper may act as a midwife for a daughter of Israel in a time when others stand over her, but when they are alone together, it is prohibited, because they suspect (idol worshipers) of (taking) lives. One may be treated by them (provided that it is) monetary treatment, but not personal treatment. An idol worshiper should not cut the embryo from the female organs of an Israelite woman, and she should not drink a cup of infertility potion, because they suspect (idol worshipers) of (taking) lives. An Israelite should not be alone with an idol worshiper, whether to bathe or in a bathhouse. An Israelite who encounters an idol worshiper on the road should (put the idol worshiper) to his right and not to his left. R. Yishmael ben R. Yohanan ben Beroqa says, (if the idol worshiper has) a sword, to his right. (If the idol worshiper has) a stick, to his left. (If) the two of them go up an incline or down a decline, the Israelite should stay above and the idol worshiper below. And he should not bend down before him, lest the idol worshiper break his skull. He should extend the journey (if an idol worshiper) asks him where he is going and divert him from the path, as it says Jacob did to Esau (Genesis 33): \"until I come upon my lord at Seir,\" but he went to Sukkot. An Israelite may get a haircut from an idol worshiper (if) he can see in a mirror. (If) from a Samaritan, he does not need to look in a mirror. The house of Rabban Gamaliel permitted one to look in the mirror because they are in constant with the government. An Israelite who cuts the hair of idol worshiper, when he reaches the forelock, he should remove his hand."
