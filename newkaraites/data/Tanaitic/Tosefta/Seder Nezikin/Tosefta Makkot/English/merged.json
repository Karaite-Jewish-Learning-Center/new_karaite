Aqiba says he also does not pay on his own account because it is a penalty and anything that is a penalty one does not pay on his own account. Witnesses who said, \"we testify about so-and-so that borrowed from so-and-so one thousand zuz on such-and-such day in such-and-such place.\" And others came and said to them, \"how can you testify for the borrower or the lender was with us on that day in that place,\" these are not scheming witnesses but their testimony is invalidated. But if they said to them, \"how can you testify for you all were with us that day in that place,\" these are scheming witnesses and pay on their account.",
            "2": "Witnesses who said, \"we testify about so-and-so that he blinded the eye of his slave and afterward knocked out his tooth,\" (for such the master says) and afterwards were found to be scheming pay the slave. \"He knocked out his tooth and afterward blinded his eye,\" (for such the slaves say) and afterwards were found to be scheming pay the master. \"Blinded both of them at once and knocked a tooth at once,\" and others came and said, \"no, but both of them were consecutive,\" and they turned out to be scheming, they pay the slave. \"He blinded both of them consecutively and knocked out both of them consecutively,\" and others came and said, \"no, but but of them simultaneously,\" and they turned out to be scheming, they pay the value of a blind slave to the master. \"He blinded the eye of his slave and behold he is still employed and serving,\" and they turn out to be scheming, they pay the value of a blind slave to the master.",
            "3": "Witnesses who said, \"we testify about so-and-so that he divorced his wife but did not give her her Ketubah,\" (and that is what the woman says) and they turn out to be scheming they pay the value of the Ketubah to the man. \"He divorced his wife and gave her her Ketubah,\" (and that is what the man says) and they turn out to be scheming they pay the value of the Ketubah to the woman. \"He divorced his wife and did not give her her Ketubah but behold she is under him and serving him,\" and they turn out to be scheming, we don't say they pay her Ketubah, but the benefit value of the Ketubah. What is the benefit value of a Ketubah? We don't say how much a man would give for this Ketubah for if she dies in her husband's lifetime the husband would inherit her and if after her husband's death she inherits her Ketubah and does not bequeath it. Therefore they pay. "
