Even though there's no explicit proof for this, it's a remembrance for that which is discussed (Tzefaniah 1) \"And in that time I will look through Jerusalem by candle\" and that which it says (Proverbs 20) \"The candle of God is a human soul\".",
            "1": "Bet Shamai say: \"Two rows on the entire cellar -- the outer row which faces the door, and the uppermost which faces the ceiling. [but the lower rows and the inner rows don't need checking].\" Bet Hillel say: \"[The outer row is] the uppermost which faces the door and those under it. However the rows that are more inwards from it don't need checking\"."

They (the community) should give him no fewer than 4 cups of wine [that has in it at least 1/4 (?)... whether it is old or new.  R' Yehuda says, it should at least have the smell and taste of wine.",
            "1": "They mix him the first cup. Beit Shammai says, he blesses on the day and then he blesses on the wine, because the holiday is the direct reason for drinking the wine, and the holiday had already started when the wine was brought to the table. Beit Hillel says, he blesses on the wine and then he blesses on the day, because if we didn't have the wine we wouldn't be saying Kiddush on the holiday at all. Another explanation: the blessing on wine is regularly said and the blessing on the holiday is not. And the halacha is according to Beit Hillel.",
            "2": "It is a mitzvah for a person to make his children and the members of his house happy on the festivals. Through what [should he make them happy]? With wine! [As it is written (Psalm 104): \"And wine will make the heart of man happy, etc.\"]. Rabbi Yehudah said: [Women] with what is nice for them and children with what is nice for them.",
            "5": "Rabbi Eliezer says, \"We snatch the matzot for the small children so that they don't fall asleep.\" Rabbi Yehuda said in his name, \"Even if he only ate one entree, even if he only dipped one [piece of] lettuce, we snatch the matzot for the small children so that they don't fall asleep.\" Up until [which point in <i>Hallel</i> - Psalms of thanksgiving recited joyously and communally on many festivals] should one recite [before the meal]?  Beit Shammai says, \"Up to [the verse that ends with the phrase] 'A happy mother of children'\" (Psalms 113:9).  Beit Hillel says, \"Up to [the verse that ends with the phrase] 'flint stone into a water-spring'\" (Psalms 114:8). And one should conclude [this section of <i>Hallel</i> with [the blessing of] redemption. Beit Shammai, said to Beit Hillel, \"And did they already go out [of Egypt at this time] that we [already] mention the going out of Egypt?\" Beit Hillel said [back] to them, \"Even if he waits for the call of the rooster, behold, they didn't go out until six hours into the day; how is it that he says 'the redemption' [when] they have not yet been redeemed?\"",
            "7": "We may not eat an <i>afikoman</i> [a dessert or other foods eaten after the meal] after [we are finished eating] the Pesach sacrifice; for example nuts, dates and roasted wheat. A man is obligated to be involved with the laws of Pesach the whole night, even if it [is only a discussion] between him and his son, even if it is between him and himself, even if it is between him and his student. It happened that Rabban Gamliel and the Elders were [once] reclining in the house of Beitos ben Zunin in Lud, and they were involved with the laws of Pesach the whole night until the call of the rooster. [Their students] raised the covering of the window from in front of them, and they [then] convened and went to the house of study. What is the blessing on the Pesach sacrifice? Blessed [...] who has sanctified us with His commandments and has commanded us on the eating of the Pesach sacrifice. What is the blessing on the [other] offerings? Blessed [...] who has sanctified us with His commandments and has commanded us on the eating of the offering.",

            "11": "Once, Rabban Gamliel and the elders were reclining in the house of Boethus ben Zonin in Lod, and they were occupied in studying the laws of Pesach all that night, until the cock crowed. They lifted the table, made themselves ready and went to the house of study [to pray]."
