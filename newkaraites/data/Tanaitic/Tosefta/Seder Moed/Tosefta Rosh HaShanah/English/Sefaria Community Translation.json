The measure of a <i>teki'ah</i> blast is like three <i>teru'ah</i> blasts; while the measure of each<i>teru'ah</i> blast is like three sobs (<i>yevavot</i>). If one heard six <i>teki'ah</i> blasts and three <i>teru'ah</i> blasts - even at intervals, and even spread out over the entire day - the obligation is fulfilled. If one heard a <i>teki'ah</i> from one and a <i>teru'ah</i> from another, even at intervals, and even spread out over the entire day - the obligation is fulfilled. If one heard the shofar blasts and the blessings - whether the blessings preceded the blasts or vice versa, the obligation is fulfilled. If one blew a <i>teki'ah</i>, a <i>teru'ah</i> and then a <i>teki'ah</i>, and then completed the set with [only] a <i>teru'ah</i> and a<i>teki'ah</i> - this only counts as one set. And if one blew a <i>teki'ah</i>, a <i>teru'ah</i> and then a <i>teki'ah</i> in one breath - the obligation is not fulfilled. One can learn to blow the shofar on Shabbat. One does not prevent women and children from blowing on Shabbat, nor on festive days."
