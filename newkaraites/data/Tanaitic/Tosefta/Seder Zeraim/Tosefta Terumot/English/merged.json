Godgeda who were deaf, and all of the purity rules of Jerusalem were taken care of by them. They said to him regarding that proof, that the purity rules do not require thought, and [thus] they are taken care of by those who are deaf, insane, or minors, [but] terumah and tithes require thought. R. Yitzhak says in the name of R. Elezar: The terumah of one who is deaf should not go out as profane, because there is doubt – perhaps he has knowledge, perhaps he does not have knowledge. How [should] they treat him? The court [should] assign him guardians, [so that when] he sets aside terumah they confirm for him [that he has done it correctly]. R. Simon b. Gamliel says: Who is considered to be deaf? Everyone who was deaf from his birth [is considered to be deaf], but one who [initially] is sensible and becomes deaf, he writes and they provide confirmation. ",
            "1": "One who hears and does not speak – he is mute. One who speaks and does not hear – he is deaf. And in both cases regard him as one who is sensible in all respects. ",
            "2": "Who is considered to be insane? One who goes out alone at night, and one who stays overnight in the cemetery, and one who tears his chair, and one who destroys things that people give to him. [For one who is] sometimes insane, sometimes sane, this is the general rule: Whenever he is insane, regard him as someone who is insane in all respects, and [whenever he is] sane, regard him as someone who is sensible in all respects.",
            "3": "R. Yehuda says: A minor whose father places him in a cucumber field – [when] he sets aside terumah and his father speaks  on his behalf, his terumah is a [valid] terumah. They said: It is not he [the minor] who sets aside terumah, but rather his father who confirms his act.",
            "4": "How could someone set aside as terumah something that does not belong to him? He could go down to the middle of his neighbor’s field and glean and set aside terumah while not being in poverty.  If they consider it robbery,  his terumah is not a [valid] terumah, but if not, his terumah is a [valid] terumah. How could one know if it were considered robbery or not? The case when the master of the house comes out and finds him, and says to him: ‘Cut it out!’ with pleasantries – if there were pleasantries it is not considered robbery, but if not, regard it to be considered robbery. If the master of the house had harvested and added to it, in either case it is not considered robbery."

            "22": "A group of [Jews] to whom gentiles say, “Give us one of you and we shall kill him, and if not, behold, we will kill all of them”; they should let themselves be killed and not deliver them one soul from Israel. But if they designated [the person] to them – for example, Sheva ben Bichri – they should give him to them and not let themselves be killed. Rabbi Yehuda said, “When do these words apply? In a case when he is [inside and they are] outside [a fortified city]; but in a case when he is inside and they are inside, since he will be killed and the [other Jews] will be killed, they should give him to them and not let themselves all be killed. And so did it state (II Samuel 20:22), ‘And the woman come to all of the people in her wisdom, etc.’ – she said to them, ‘Since he will be killed and you will be killed, give him to them and do not kill all of you.’” Rabbi Shimon says, “So did she say [to them], ‘Anyone who rebels against the monarchy [of the House of David] is liable to [receive] the death penalty.’”"
