            "0": "The traditional ritual of “kaporos,” atonement, is mentioned in the writings of the Ari Z'al and the Sh'lah haKodosh. It is the custom on the morning of the eve of the Day of Atonement (or even a day before) to ritually slaughter a chicken as a symbol of atonement. It is customary for a male to use a rooster and a female to use a hen. According to some, the slaughtered chickens are given to the poor, but others hold that it is more appropriate to give them the value of the chickens rather than the actual chickens. If there is no possibility of observing the ritual of kaporos with live chickens, you may use money instead and present the money to the poor.",
            "1": "The following verses which introduce the ritual itself are taken from Psalms 107:10, 14, 17-21, and the last two verses are from Job 33:23,24. These verses portray the misery and affliction which man creates for himself through his disobedience to God. Though his path of sin leads to self-destruction, God stands ready to save him and heal him if he but cries out in true repentance.",

Your wisdom has so decreed, as it is written in Your Torah, “See, I have set before you this day, life and good, and death and evil; and you should choose life.” But now, my God, I have not listened to Your voice but have followed the advice of the Evil Impulse and the inclinations of my heart. I have despised that which is good and chosen that which is evil. Not only have I failed to sanctify the vital parts of my body but I have caused them to be impure. You created me with a mind and a heart, giving me the faculty of thought in order that I might think of what is good and pure, that I might understand Your holy Torah, that I might pray to You, and pronounce all the blessings with pure thoughts. But I have caused them to be impure with foreign thoughts and ideas. Not only that, but as a result of these evil thoughts, I have been brought to a state of bodily impurity, sometimes willfully and other times accidentally. Woe is to me!

The toil of earning a livelihood to support my family, and the vicissitudes of life, afflict me greatly. And since it is obvious to You that there is no righteous man on earth who does only good, who never sins; with Your great compassion, You have given us one day in the year, a great and holy day, this Day of Atonement, to return unto You in repentance, that You might atone our sins and cleanse us of all our impurities.

If we have transgressed and rebelled as is likely for a being of flesh and blood; You O God, act in accordance with Your Divine attribute, which is to forgive and pardon. Do not let our sins prevent us from returning to You in repentance, for Your way is to accept the penitent. Strengthen our hearts in Your Torah and in fear of You, so that the fear of You will be steadfast in our hearts. Purify our thoughts and ideas that we may serve You, and observe from my broken heart how I regret the evil deeds I have committed to this day. I weep, lament and confess all my sins as I say, “I have erred, sinned deliberately and transgressed before You.”",

Let my numerous sins not prevent me from returning to You with a whole heart. Grant that I may truly return unto You effecting complete repentance for my sins, and that I may abandon my evil deeds forever. Have compassion on me and save me forever from all sin and iniquity; for without Your great compassion and loving kindness it would be impossible to resist the Evil Inclination that burns like fire within me. Therefore, have compassion on me, give me strength to resist him, as our Sages said, “He who strives to cleanse himself receives Divine aid.”",

I am prepared to fast and undergo the five deprivations which You commanded us through Your servant Moshe, in Your holy Torah: to deprive ourselves of eating and drinking, washing, anointing with oil, wearing shoes [of leather], and marital relations; and to abstain from all manner of work on this holy day. Because we deprive ourselves of food and drink, we pray that You will atone the sins we committed by partaking of forbidden food and drink; because we deprive ourselves of washing and anointing, may You atone the sins we committed by enjoying forbidden pleasures; because we deprive ourselves of wearing [leather] shoes, may You atone the sins we committed with our feet, hastening to do evil deeds, and also for having transgressed the twenty four precepts for which the Beth Din decrees a ban mandating that one must apppear barefoot; because we de prive ourselves of marital relations, may You atone the sins we committed in forbidden sexual matters.",
            "36": "May the five prayers [of the Day of Atonement], and our supplications, make amends for sins we committed with the five components of speech: the palate, the throat, the tongue, the teeth and the lips, which I rendered unclean by uttering forbidden words (profanity etc.), vows and oaths. Through our embracing and kissing the Torah Scrolls, and in the merit of our prayers that we offer on this holy day, may the prayers we offered, without proper concentration and devotion, during the whole year, ascend and reach You, and be accepted together with the prayers of this holy day. May all our prayers go up to heaven and form a crown to adorn Your head. And may the tears that our eyes will shed, amend the sins we have committed with our eyes, looking at things which are unclean and impure. May the feverish heat of our bodies through fasting and praying, amend the blemishes we have caused the two hundred forty-eight organs and the three hundred sixty-five veins, of our body, with the fiery passion of the Evil Inclination. And because we allow our flesh and blood to be diminished by abstaining from food and drink, may we achieve atonement for all our errors, deliberate sins, and transgressions before You. May our fast be considered before You as though we have sacrificed ourselves upon the altar, and may it be accepted before You for a pleasing savor, as a sacrifice and a burnt-offering.",
            "37": "We know according to the dictates of repentance, that we should fast for each and every sin we have committed, and that our suffering must be commensurate with the pleasure we have derived from such sins. But You know, O God, that we are too weak to fast even for one sin, certainly not for each and every sin; for they are too numerous and our strength is too feeble. Therefore, may it be Your will Adonoy, our God, that the fast on this holy day, this Day of Atonement, be an atonement for all our iniquities.",
            "38": "May it be Your will, Almighty, King, Who sits on the throne of mercy, Who desires the repentance of the wicked, that our love for You, and fear of You be instilled in our hearts and in the heart of all Your people Yisrael, that we may fear You all the days. Have compassion upon the transgressors among Your people, Yisrael, and instill in their hearts the fear of the glory of Your majesty; and humble their hearts of stone, that they may return to You [in repentance] with all their heart, as You promised by the hand of Your prophets, “That even the outcast will not be banished from Him.” Even if their guilt is so great that the ways of repentance are closed to them, with Your great compassion, open new channels for them beneath Your Divine throne, and accept their repentance. Have compassion on us and give us strength to serve You all the days, and remove from us all the obstacles and causes that prevent us from serving You. You are our Creator and You know all the faults of men and their nature which prevent them from serving You; and it is within Your power to remove all these obstacles. Do not let the troubled times and confusion prevent us from returning unto You with all our heart; and may all our days be filled with repentance and good deeds, until the very last moment; when it will be Your will to gather our souls unto You. At that time all our thoughts will be of You and then our souls will depart in holiness and purity; and may we merit that our souls be elevated on high.",
            "39": "Give us strength to fast on this holy day, and may we complete the fast observing all the five deprivations; and may our misdeeds not cause us to fail in any one of them, for we are all the children of Avraham, Yitzchak, and Yaakov, whom You loved. May we have the merit to raise our children to study Torah and perform good deeds, and may they not be ensnared, God forbid, because of our iniquity. Seal us in the Book of good life, a life in which we will fear Your Name, a life in which we will serve You with all our heart; a life in which we will not be entrapped, God forbid, in sin, iniquity or guilt; a life of sustenance with ease, dignity and honesty; and may our pursuit of a livelihood not be disturbed with the turbulence of the times. Grant us our sustenance in serenity and tranquility, and independence, so that we will be free to worship You. Purify our thoughts so that we may cling unto You always. Because I know that there is no righteous man in the world who has not wronged his fellow man, whether it be in regard to monetary matters, or in personal matters, whether through deeds or through words, my heart grieves, for the Day of Atonement does not atone for sins committed against a fellow man, unless the wronged person has been fully appeased. Knowing this, my heart is shattered and my bones tremble, for even the day of death does not atone for such sins. I therefore beseech You to have compassion on me and grant that I find favor and mercy in Your eyes, and in the eyes of all men. I hereby grant absolute forgiveness to anyone who has sinned against me, whether personally or with his money, whether with malicious gossip, or with slander. So too, I release anyone who has injured me either in person or in property, or anyone who has committed any manner of sin which is considered between man and man, except such money due me which is collectible according to the Halacha of Beth Din, and except the person who wronged me deliberately, thinking, “I will wrong him but he will eventually forgive me.” Except for these, I unconditionally forgive everyone; and may no one be punished because of me. And just as I forgive everyone, grant that I find favor in the eyes of all men, so that they will grant absolute forgiveness to me.",
            "40": "May our prayer ascend, reach, be heard and accepted. Accept the prayer of Your people; strengthen us, purify us, Awesome One. May the holiness of the Day of Atonement arouse Your attributes of greatness, might, glory, victory and majesty, for all that is in heaven and on earth is Yours; for Yours Adonoy is the Kingdom. Light is sown for the righteous, and for the upright in heart—joy; and may the holiness of the Day of Atonement be spread over them to cause our sins to be atoned, as it is written, “For on this day He will make atonement for you to cleanse you; from all your sins, before Adonoy you will be cleansed.” “May the pleasantness of my Master, our God, be upon us, and the work of our hands established for us, and the work of our hands—establish it.” Remove the rule of evil from our heart, and reign over the entire world with Your glory, and be uplifted over all the earth with Your honor. Great joy to Your land, gladness to Your city, and flourishing pride to Dovid, Your servant. May the words of my mouth and the thoughts of my heart be accepted before You, Adonoy, my Rock and My Redeemer."

According to Avudraham, the Sages chose this word to convey the thought expressed by Esther as she prepared to go before the king on behalf of her people. After telling Mordechai to assemble all the Jews to fast for three days and nights on her behalf, she said, “וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ and so I will go in to the king” (Esther 4:16). Thus, since today is the Day of Judgment, as we come before the Supreme King of kings, the Holy One Blessed is He, we begin with the words uttered by Esther as she came before the king. The Siddur Maggid Tzedek quoted by Siach Yitzchak writes that the emphasis of Avudraham was on the last words of the verse said by Esther, “וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ אֲשֶׁר לֹא כַדָּת,” “And so I will go into the king, even if it is unlawful,” for which one of us can say, “I am virtuous, I have cleansed my heart from sin.” Especially on this great and awesome Day of Judgment, who among us is not embarrassed and ashamed to appear before the King of kings garbed in sackcloths of sin. If Esther who had fasted for three days in penitence and prayer in preparation for her appearance before the king was nevertheless so terribly frightened that she declared: “וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ אֲשֶׁר לֹא כַדָּת” then we should certainly tremble in awe before the presence of Hashem on this Day of Judgment, knowing deep in our hearts how little and how poorly we have prepared ourselves. Thus our Sages ordained that we open the prayers with the word וּבְכֵן recalling the words of Esther; therewith shattering our delusions of spiritual complacency, and causing us to bow before Him with broken hearts and tear-filled eyes.</i></b>",

According to Targum Yonassan ben Uziel, however, the words מִכֹּל חַטֹאתֵיכֶם are joined to the previous words—לְטַהֵר אֶתְכֶם—changing the entire concept of the sentence. According to the Targum the sentence reads: כִּי בַיּוֹם הַזֶה יְכַפֵּר עֲלֵיכֶם לְטַהֵר אֶתְכֶם מִכֹּל חַטֹאתֵיכֶם. “For on this day He will make atonement for you to cleanse you from all your sins”; and thus the final three words of the sentence לִפְנֵי ה' תִּטְהָרוּ represent a command to cleanse ourselves before Him, as the Targum says: וְאַתּוּן קָדָם ה' תּוֹדוּן סוּרְחָנוּתְכוֹן וְתִדְכּוּן “And you—confess your wrongdoings before Hashem, and then you will be cleansed.” Klei Yakar, obviously influenced by Targum explicitly states that this sentence is not a blanket promise of atonement, for Yom Kippur atones only for those who cleanse themselves with honest repentance.</i>",

Our Sages attach much significance to Psalm 145 in particular, and stated: “Whoever recites ‘A praise by Dovid' three times a day is assuredly worthy of a share in the world to come” (Maseches Berachos 4b). When recited in prayer, this psalm is always introduced with two verses from other Psalms (84:5 and 144:15). These verses contain the word fortunate three times, an allusion to this psalm being recited three times a day.

According to Avudraham, the Sages chose this word to convey the thought expressed by Esther as she prepared to go before the king on behalf of her people. After telling Mordechai to assemble all the Jews to fast for three days and nights on her behalf, she said, “ וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ and so I will go in to the king” (Esther 4:16). Thus, since today is the Day of Judgment, as we come before the Supreme King of kings, the Holy One Blessed is He, we begin with the words uttered by Esther as she came before the king. The Siddur Maggid Tzedek quoted by Siach Yitzchak writes that the emphasis of Avudraham was on the last words of the verse said by Esther, “וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ אֲשֶׁר לֹא כַדָּת,” “And so I will go into the king, even if it is unlawful,” for which one of us can say, “I am virtuous, I have cleansed my heart from sin.” Especially on this great and awesome Day of Judgment, who among us is not embarrassed and ashamed to appear before the King of kings garbed in sackcloths of sin. If Esther who had fasted for three days in penitence and prayer in preparation for her appearance before the king was nevertheless so terribly frightened that she declared: “וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ אֲשֶׁר לֹא כַדָּת” then we should certainly tremble in awe before the presence of Hashem on this Day of Judgment, knowing deep in our hearts how little and how poorly we have prepared ourselves. Thus our Sages ordained that we open the prayers with the word וּבְכֵן recalling the words of Esther; therewith shattering our delusions of spiritual complacency, and causing us to bow before Him with broken hearts and tear-filled eyes.</i></b>",

According to Targum Yonassan ben Uziel, however, the words מִכֹּל חַטֹאתֵיכֶם are joined to the previous words—לְטַהֵר אֶתְכֶם—changing the entire concept of the sentence. According to the Targum the sentence reads: כִּי בַיּוֹם הַזֶה יְכַפֵּר עֲלֵיכֶם לְטַהֵר אֶתְכֶם מִכֹּל חַטֹאתֵיכֶם. “For on this day He will make atonement for you to cleanse you from all your sins”; and thus the final three words of the sentence לִפְנֵי ה' תִּטְהָרוּ represent a command to cleanse ourselves before Him, as the Targum says: וְאַתּוּן קָדָם ה' תּוֹדוּן סוּרְחָנוּתְכוֹן וְתִדְכּוּן “And you—confess your wrongdoings before Hashem, and then you will be cleansed.” Klei Yakar, obviously influenced by Targum explicitly states that this sentence is not a blanket promise of atonement, for Yom Kippur atones only for those who cleanse themselves with honest repentance.</i>",

For thus spoke the High and Lofty One, Who dwells in eternity, Whose Name is the Holy One: Though I dwell in the high and holy place, I am with the lowly and those of humble spirit; to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the hearts of the contrite. For I will not contend forever, nor forever shall I be wroth. For man's spirit that enwraps him is from Me; and the souls, I have made. I was angered by the sin of his greed (unjust gain) and I struck him; I concealed Myself from him and was wroth; yet still he went rebelliously after his heart's desires. I have seen his ways and healed him; I will lead him and restore comfort to him and his mourners. I will create a new speech (for him) and they shall say: “Peace, peace to the estranged (far off) and to the near, said Adonoy.” And I will heal him. But the wicked are like the stormy sea; it cannot rest and its waves cast up mire and mud. “There is no peace,” said my God, “for the wicked.” Cry out loud and do not refrain, raise your voice like the shofar and tell My people of their transgressions, and the House of Yaakov of their sins. Yet they seek Me daily and desire to know My ways; like a righteous nation who has not forsaken the law of their God; they ask Me about righteous laws, they desire to draw near to God. (They ask) Why do You not see when we fast; we afflict our souls and You do not notice? For on your fast day you seek business and oppress your labourers. You fast for strife and contention; to smite with a fist of wickedness; you do not fast this day to make your voices heard on high. Can this then be the fast that I have chosen—a day when man afflicts his soul, to bow down his head like a reed, to sit in sackcloth and ashes? Is this what you call a fast, an acceptable day to Adonoy? Behold, this is the fast that I have chosen—loosening the bonds of wickedness, undoing the straps of the yoke, sending the oppressed free and breaking every yoke (of tyranny). Break your bread with the hungry, and bring the impoverished into your home; clothe the naked when you see them and do not hide from your own flesh (relatives). Then will your light break forth like the dawn, and your healing shall come quickly; your righteousness will go before you and the Glory of Adonoy will gather you up. Then when you call out, Adonoy will answer; when you cry out, He shall say: “I am here.” If you remove from your midst the yokes, the stretching out of a finger and wrongful speech. If you reach out to the hungry and satisfy the afflicted soul, then your light shall shine forth in the darkness; and your deep darkness shall be as light as noon. Adonoy will always guide you and satisfy your soul from thirst and make strong your bones. And you shall be like a watered garden, and like a never failing spring of water. And from you shall they build up the old ruins; you shall raise up the foundations of generation after generation; and they shall call you: the repairer of the breach, the restorer of the path to dwell in. If you will keep back your foot because of Shabbos, and not pursue your business on My Holy Day, and if you will call Shabbos, a delight, holy to Adonoy and honoured, and honor it by refraining from doing your ways and pursuing your desires or speaking of them, Then shall you delight in Adonoy and I will set you on the high places of the earth and you shall enjoy the heritage of Yaakov, your father, for the mouth of Adonoy has spoken it.",

In the section dealing with laws of Rosh Hashana (Section 276), he writes, “I found a letter from Rabbi Ephraim of Bonn, in which he wrote that Rabbi Amnon of Mayence authored the וּנְתַנֶּה תֹּקֶף as a result of a tragic incident in his life.” This is the story as recorded in the letter:",
                "323": "Rabbi Amnon of Mayence, a great scholar, a person of wealth, a handsome man of noble ancestry was under great pressure from the lords and Archbishop of the city to change his faith and adopt their religion. He repeatedly ignored them but on one occasion, in order to put them off, he asked for three days to consider their request. Afterwards he was heartbroken because he had given the impression that he might actually consider renouncing his belief in the One Living God. He refused food or drink; weeping bitterly over his lapse, he refused to accept the sympathy and consolation of friends and relatives.",
                "324": "At the end of the three days he was summoned by the Archbishop, but he ignored the summons. A distinguished delegation was sent to ask him to appear at the court but he refused them. Finally, he was brought before the court by force, and the Archbishop demanded, “Why did you not come and answer me as you promised?” Rabbi Amnon answered, “As a punishment, you should have my tongue cut out, because my tougue deceived you.” Rabbi Amnon thought to sanctify God's Name in this manner, since his tongue had uttered such a promise. The Archbishop replied, “No, I will not cut out your tongue for it spoke well, instead, I will cut off your feet for they did not bring you to me.” The tyrant ordered that his hands and feet be cut off in piecemeal fashion; asking him at each interval if he was willing to renounce his faith. He was finally released and sent home with his severed and mutilated limbs aside him in bed.",
                "325": "The holiday of Rosh Hashana was at hand, and the Rabbi, dying from the effects of his wounds, was at his own request carried into the synagogue, bringing his severed limbs with him. When the Chazzan was about to recite the Kedushah, Rabbi Amnon asked him to stop, saying, “Pause that I may sanctify His Most Holy Name,” and he said in a loud voice: וּבְכֵן וּלְךָ תַעֲלֶה קְדֻשָּׁה, and thus may this sanctification ascend to You, inferring that with his terrible suffering, he had sanctified God's Name. He then began reciting the וּנְתַנֶּה תֹּקֶף, and with the words אֱמֶת כִּי אַתָּה הוּא דַיָּן וּמוֹכִֽיח, true that You are Judge and Admonisher, he indicated his acceptance of God's Divine judgment, and with the words וְתִכְתֹּב אֶת גְּזַר דִּינָם, and You recorded the decree of their judgments, he manifested his belief that his fate had been decreed on Rosh Hashana. No sooner had he finished the prayer when he expired. Three days later, he appeared to Rabbi Kolonymus ben Meshullam in a dream and taught him this prayer, asking him to introduce it to all congregations as a testimonial and as a memorial for him. This prayer has formed a portion of our Service ever since.",

And they shall cover themselves with sackcloth, both man and animal, and let them call out earnestly to God, and let each man turn back from his evil way and from the robbery which is in their hands.

I therefore hastened to flee to Tarshish, for I knew You are Almighty, Gracious and Merciful, Abounding in kindness and relenting of evil. And so now Adonoy, please take my life from me, for it is better for me to die than to live.” And Adonoy said [to him], “Are you correct in being so grieved?”",

He made a booth for himself and sat under it in the shade, waiting to see what would happen in the city. Then Adonoy, God, caused a kikayon<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rashi identifies kikayon as a plant of many leaves which provide shade. Ibn Ezra, identifies as a gourd.</i> to grow and rise up over Yonah, to shade his head, to alleviate his discomfort. And Yonah rejoiced greatly over the kikayon. Then God caused a worm to attack the kikayon at the dawn of the netx day, and it [the kikayon] withered. At sunrise, God caused a hot—stifling east wind [to blow]; the sun beat upon Yonah's head and he felt faint. He asked for death, saying, “It is better for me to die than to live.” And God said to Yonah, “Are You correct in being so grieved over the kikayon?” And he answered, “I am so grieved that I can die.” And Adonoy said, “You had pity for the kikayon for which you did not toil nor did you cause it to grow, it sprang up overnight and it perished overnight. And I, shall I not have pity upon Ninveh, the great city of more than one hundred and twenty thousand persons who do not know their right hand from their left, and many cattle as well?”",

This prayer is not recited on the Sabbath.",

                "0": "The concluding Service of Yom Kippur forms the climax of Jewish devotion on this holiest day of the year. The literal meaning of the word Neilah is “the closing of the gates.” In ancient times, there was a daily prayer in the Temple just before the closing of the gates in the evening. Outside the Temple there was a similar closing prayer on public fast-days. At the urging of Rav, who had a decisive influence on the Yom Kippur liturgy, this special prayer was instituted in the form of a new Amidah. In later times the word neilah was taken to mean “closing of the Heavenly Gates.” Thus we have the prayer, “Open for us the gate at the time of closing the gate, for the day has declined.” The key-note of the Neilah Service is the prayer אַתָּה נוֹתֵן יַד, “You are willing to meet even [those who deliberately transgressed Your Law]. You give them the call and the opportunity to return to You, and You are ready at all times to receive those who return. Let no one, therefore say, “it is too late.”",
