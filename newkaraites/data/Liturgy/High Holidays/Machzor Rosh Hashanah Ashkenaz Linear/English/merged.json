He further writes that since זְרִיזִין מַקְדִימִין לְמִצְוֹת, the diligent come early to perform their religious duties. It is commendable to invalidate one’s vows before Rosh Hashana with the declaration contained in the “הַתָּרַת נְדָרִים,” the Annulment of Vows.",

According to Avudraham, the Sages chose this word to convey the thought expressed by Esther as she prepared to go before the king on behalf of her people. After telling Mordechai to assemble all the Jews to fast for three days and nights on her behalf, she said, “ וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ ‘and so I will go in to the king” (Esther 4:16). Thus, since today is the Day of Judgment, as we come before the Supreme King of kings, the Holy One Blessed is He, we begin with the words uttered by Esther as she came before the king. The Siddur Maggid Tzedek quoted by Siach Yitzchak writes that the emphasis of Avudraham was on the last words of the verse said by Esther, “וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ אֲשֶׁר לֹא כַדָּת,” “And so I will go into the king, even if it is unlawful,” for which one of us can say, “I am virtuous, I have cleansed my heart from sin.” Especially on this great and awesome Day of Judgment, who among us is not embarrassed and ashamed to appear before the King of kings garbed in sackcloths of sin. If Esther who had fasted for three days in penitence and prayer in preparation for her appearance before the king was nevertheless so terribly frightened that she declared: “וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ אֲשֶׁר לֹא כַדָּת” then we should certainly tremble in awe before the presence of Hashem on this Day of Judgment, knowing deep in our hearts how little and how poorly we have prepared ourselves. Thus our Sages ordained that we open the prayers with the word וּבְכֵן recalling the words of Esther; therewith shattering our delusiouns of spiritual complacency, and causing us to bow before Him with broken hearts and tear-filled eyes.</i>",

First make the blessing, “בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה ה' אֱלֹהֵֽינוּ מֶֽלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם בּוֹרֵא פְּרִי הָעֵץ—Blessed are You, Adonoy, our God, King of the universe, Who creates the fruit of the tree.” After tasting it, repeat the above prayer, “יְהִי רָצוֹן—May it be Your will to renew for us a good and sweet year.” It is also a custom to eat a piece of the head of some animal, (preferably a sheep) and say: “יְהִי רָצוֹן שֶׁנִהְיֶה לְראשׁ—May it be Your will that we be at the head.” We also eat certain vegetables, the names of which convey the connotations of good fortune, such as carrots which in Yiddish are called mehren (increase), and we say: “יְהִי רָצוֹן שֶׁיִרְבּוּ זְכוּיוֹתֵינוּ—May it be Your will that our merits increase.”"

According to Avudraham, the Sages chose this word to convey the thought expressed by Esther as she prepared to go before the king on behalf of her people. After telling Mordechai to assemble all the Jews to fast for three days and nights on her behalf, she said, “וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ and so I will go in to the king” (Esther 4:16). Thus, since today is the Day of Judgment, as we come before the Supreme King of kings, the Holy One Blessed is He, we begin with the words uttered by Esther as she came before the king. The Siddur Maggid Tzedek quoted by Siach Yitzchak writes that the emphasis of Avudraham was on the last words of the verse said by Esther, “וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ אֲשֶׁר לֹא כַדָּת,” “And so I will go into the king, even if it is unlawful,” for which one of us can say, “I am virtuous, I have cleansed my heart from sin.” Especially on this great and awesome Day of Judgment, who among us is not embarrassed and ashamed to appear before the King of kings garbed in sackcloths of sin. If Esther who had fasted for three days in penitence and prayer in preparation for her appearance before the king was nevertheless so terribly frightened that she declared: “וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ אֲשֶׁר לֹא כַדָּת” then we should certainly tremble in awe before the presence of Hashem on this Day of Judgment, knowing deep in our hearts how little and how poorly we have prepared ourselves. Thus our Sages ordained that we open the prayers with the word וּבְכֵן recalling the words of Esther; therewith shattering our delusions of spiritual complacency, and causing us to bow before Him with broken hearts and tear-filled eyes.</i>",

According to Avudraham, the Sages chose this word to convey the thought expressed by Esther as she prepared to go before the king on behalf of her people. After telling Mordechai to assemble all the Jews to fast for three days and nights on her behalf, she said, “ וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ and so I will go in to the king” (Esther 4:16). Thus, since today is the Day of Judgment, as we come before the Supreme King of kings, the Holy One Blessed is He, we begin with the words uttered by Esther as she came before the king. The Siddur Maggid Tzedek quoted by Siach Yitzchak writes that the emphasis of Avudraham was on the last words of the verse said by Esther, “וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ אֲשֶׁר לֹא כַדָּת,” “And so I will go into the king, even if it is unlawful,” for which one of us can say, “I am virtuous, I have cleansed my heart from sin.” Especially on this great and awesome Day of Judgment, who among us is not embarrassed and ashamed to appear before the King of kings garbed in sackcloths of sin. If Esther who had fasted for three days in penitence and prayer in preparation for her appearance before the king was nevertheless so terribly frightened that she declared: “וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ אֲשֶׁר לֹא כַדָּת” then we should certainly tremble in awe before the presence of Hashem on this Day of Judgment, knowing deep in our hearts how little and how poorly we have prepared ourselves. Thus our Sages ordained that we open the prayers with the word וּבְכֵן recalling the words of Esther; therewith shattering our delusions of spiritual complacency, and causing us to bow before Him with broken hearts and tear-filled eyes.</i></b>",

And Sarah saw that the son which Hagar, the Mitzrayimian, had born unto Avraham, was mocking.<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to some, Sarah saw Yishmael commit three of the worst possible sins, adultery, idolatry, and murder. A very different opinion is expressed by Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai who said, “Heaven forbid that such sins would have been committed in Avraham’s house.” (Yishmael was fourteen years old at the time.) He maintains that Yishmael’s mockery consisted of his claiming the premier right of inheritance over Yitzchak.</i> She said to Avraham, “Drive out this slave woman and her son; for the son of this slave woman will not share the inheritance with my son Yitzchak. But the matter appeared extremely bad in the eyes of Avraham on account of his son.<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It was very difficult for him to drive Yishmael away from his house. Avraham was kind-hearted to all; even more so to his own flesh and blood. Having to drive away his son was the worst thing that every happened to Avraham (Pirkei d’Rabbi Eliezer).</i> And God said to Avraham, “Do not consider this bad for the boy and for your slave woman; regarding all that Sarah tells you, listen to her, for only through Yitzchak will offspring be called unto you.",

The water in the skin was used up,<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Although Avraham had given them sufficient food and water to reach their destination, Yishmael contracted an illness, and suffering from fever, he consumed all the water (Rashi).</i> and she threw the lad under one of the bushes. She went and sat facing him, about the distance of a bowshot away, for she said, “Let me not see the death of the lad”; and she sat facing him and wept in a loud voice. And God heard the voice of the lad,<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to Targum Yonassan, Hashem had compassion on Yishmael, and heard his voice because of Avraham’s merit.

Do not fear, for God has heard the voice of the lad in the place where he is.”<sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As Hashem was about to spare Yishmael, certain angels argued that he did not deserve miraculous intervention because of the following event that was to occur in the future: When Nebuchadnezzar drove the Jews from Yerushalayim to Babylonia, eighty thousand young kohanim, (priests) fled to the Yishmaelites. They said, “We are brothers, all we ask is some water to quench our thirst. The Yishmaelites first gave them generous helpings of salt fish, saying that it was not good to drink on an empty stomach. Since they were nearly starving, they ate the fish, which made them all the more thirsty. When they asked for water, the Yishmaelites gave them skins filled with air. When they took them to their lips, the pressure exploded their stomachs, killing many of them.<br>The angels said, “The descendants of Yishmael are destined to do such a wicked thing to Your children, killing them with thirst. How can You now save Yishmael, since he himself is also wicked? “I know,” replied the Almighty, “but I judge a person only according to what he is now, and at this point in time, Yishmael doesn’t deserve to die of thirst. See Rashi, Targum Yonassan.</i> “Arise, lift up the lad, and strengthen your hand over him, for I will make him a great nation.” And God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water; and she went and filled the skin with water and gave the lad to drink. And God was with the lad and he grew up; and he settled in the desert and he became an expert archer. He settled in the desert of Paran, and his mother took a wife for him from the land of Mitzrayim.",

And Avimelech said, “I don’t know who did this thing, neither did you tell me, and I also heard nothing of it until today.” And Avraham took sheep and cattle and gave them to Avimelech, and the two of them made a covenant.",

They made a covenant in Beer Sheba; then Avimelech and Pichol, his general, arose and returned to the land of the Philistines.

And he had two wives; one named Hannah and the other, Peninah. And Peninah had children but Hannah had no children. And this man went up from his city, from year to year, to prostrate himself and offer sacrifices to the Adonoy of Hosts, in Shiloh. And there, the two sons of Eli, Chophni and Pinchas, were priests to Adonoy. And on the day when Elkanah offered sacrifices, he gave portions to Peninah, his wife and to all her sons and daughters. And to Hannah, he gave a double portion because he loved Hannah, though Adonoy had closed up her womb. And her rival taunted her bitterly to provoke her, because Adonoy had closed up her womb. And as he did so from year to year; whenever she came up to the House of Adonoy she provoked Hannah who wept and would not eat.",
                "2": "And Elkanah, her husband, said to her: “Why do you weep? And why won’t you eat? Why is your heart grieved? Am I not better to you than ten sons?” And Hannah arose after they had eaten and drunk in Shiloh, and Eli, the Priest, sat on the chair near the door-post of the Temple of Adonoy. And she was bitterly grieved and prayed to Adonoy and wept. And she vowed a vow and said: “Adonoy of Hosts if You will see the anguish of Your handmaid and remember me and will not forget Your handmaid and will give Your handmaid a son—then I will give him to Adonoy all the days of his life and no razor shall touch his head.” And she prayed so long before Adonoy, that Eli observed her mouth. But Hannah spoke in her heart; only her lips moved but her voice was not heard. And Eli thought her to be a drunkard. And Eli said to her: “How long will you remain drunk? Free yourself from your need of wine!” And Hannah answered and said: “No, my master, I am a woman of grieved spirit; I have not drunk any wine or other intoxicating drinks. But I have poured out my soul in the presence of God. Do not take your handmaid for a wicked woman; it is only because of my sorrow and grief that I have spoken until now.”And Eli answered and said: “Go in peace! And may the God of Yisrael grant you that which you asked of Him.” And she said: “May your servant find grace in your eyes.” And the woman went on her way and she ate and she was no longer grieved.",

And in the course of days, Hannah conceived and bore a son and she called him Shmuel, because from Adonoy I asked for him. And the man Elkanah and his entire household went up to offer the yearly sacrifice and to fulfill his vows to Adonoy. But Hannah did not go up, for she told her husband: “When the boy is weaned, I will bring him to appear before Adonoy and he will remain there forever.” And Elkanah, her husband, said to her: “Do what is best in your eyes; stay here until you wean him and may Adonoy fulfill the word that was said of him.” And the woman remained and nursed her son until she weaned him. And she took him up with her, after she weaned him, along with three bullocks and an ephah of flour and a bottle of wine. And she brought him to the House of Adonoy at Shiloh, when he was still a young boy. And they slaughtered the bullock and brought the child to Eli. And she said: “Please, my master. I am the woman who stood here with you to pray to Adonoy. I prayed for this boy and Adonoy gave me what I asked of Him. And I have therefore loaned him to Adonoy; for as long as he lives, he is loaned to Adonoy.” And he prostrated himself there to Adonoy. And Hannah prayed and said: My heart exults in God; my horn is raised through Adonoy. My mouth is opened wide against my enemies, because I rejoice in Your deliverance. ",
                "4": "There is none as holy as Adonoy, for nothing else exists besides You; nor is there any rock like our God. Do not talk so much, so haughtily; nor let arrogance come out of your mouths; For Adonoy is a God of knowledge, and He weighs all of man’s actions. The bows of the powerful are broken, while the feeble are girded with strength. Those that were sated must hire themselves out to labor for bread, while those who were hungry no longer toil. While the barren woman has born seven children, she with many children languishes. Adonoy causes death and gives life; He brings down to the grave but also brings up therefrom. Adonoy impoverishes and makes rich; He lowers and He raises up. He raises up the poor from the dust, lifts up the needy from the dunghill, to seat them with nobles, and they inherit the throne of honour; for the foundations of the earth are Adonoy’s and He has set the world of man upon them. He will guard the footsteps of His pious ones, but the wicked will be silenced in darkness; for not by might shall man prevail. Those that strive against Adonoy shall be broken to pieces; Adonoy will thunder against them in the heavens. He will judge the ends of the earth and give strength to His king and raise up the horn of His anointed."

        "8_Sounding of the Shofar": {
            "0": "According to Rav Saadiah Gaon the Almighty commanded us to sound the shofar on Rosh Hashana for these ten reasons:",
            "1": "1) Rosh Hashana corresponds to the first day of creation and the shofar proclaims the sovereignty of the Creator. We are obliged to coronate God as King on this day in the manner written by Dovid, “בַּחֲצֹצְרוֹת וְקוֹל שׁוֹפָר הָרִיעוּ לִפְנֵי הַמֶּלֶךְ ה', With trumpets and the sound of shofar, call out in the presence of the King, Almighty” (Psalms 48:6).",
            "2": "2) Rosh Hashana is the beginning of the Ten Days of Repentance and the shofar calls the people to amend their lives before the final judgment of Yom Kippur. It was customary for rulers to issue a final warning to their subjects before punishing them for violating their decrees. Similarly, the shofar represents God’s last warning to His people to repent.",
            "3": "3) The sounding of the shofar recalls the revelation of the Torah on Mount Sinai. The Torah was given to us amid blasts of the shofar, as it is written, “וְקוֹל שׁוֹפָר חָזָק מְאֹד,” the sound of shofar was most powerful” (Shemos 19:16), and the people accepted it saying “We will do and we will listen.”",
            "4": "4) The shofar brings to mind the warnings and exhortations of the prophets which are likened to the blasts of the shofar, as it is said, וְשָׁמַע הַשֹׁמֵעַ אֶת קוֹל הַשׁוֹפָר וְלֹא נִזְהָר וַתָּבוֹא חֶרֶב וַתִּקָּחֵהוּ דָמוֹ בְּרֹאשׁוֹ יִהְיֶה ... וְהוּא נִזְהָר נַפְשׁוֹ מִלֵט. He who hears the sound of the shofar and does not take warning, the sword come ands takes him away, his blood will be upon his own head ... but he who heeds warning will save his soul. (Yechezkel 33:4,5).",
            "5": "5) The shofar reminds us of the destruction of the Holy Temple which was destroyed amid the sounding of enemy trumpets, as it is said: כִּי קוֹל שׁוֹפָר שָׁמַעַתְּ נַפְשִׁי תְּרוּעַת מִלְחָמָה—“For you have heard the sound of the shofar, O my soul, the shouts of battle (Yirmiyahu 4:19); and when we hear the shofar on Rosh Hashana, we pray to God to restore the Temple to its former glory.",
            "6": "6) The shofar recalls the willingness of Yitzchak to be sacrificed on the altar in obedience to God’s command to Avraham. We pray that with the sounding of the shofar his great deed will be recalled by the Almighty as a source of merit to his descendents.",
            "7": "7) It is the nature of the shofar’s sound to arouse the heart to awe and reverence. Thus when we hear the shofar, we tremble and humble ourselves before the presence of God.",
            "8": "8) The shofar reminds us of the ultimate Day of Judgment, as it is said, “קָרוֹב יוֹם ה' הַגָדוֹל, קָרוֹב וּמַהֵר מְאֹד—יוֹם שׁוֹפָר וּתְרוּעָה” “The great day of Almighty is near, it is near and rapidly approaching—a day of the shofar and shouting” (Tzefanyah 1:14, 16).",
            "9": "9) The shofar inspires us with hope for the ultimate ingathering of our people and their deliverance from exile, as it is said, “וְהָיָה בַּיוֹם הַהוּא יִתָּקַע בְּשׁוֹפָר גָדוֹל וּבָאוּ הָאֹבְדִים בְּאֶרֶץ אַשׁוּר וגו' And it will be on that day that a great shofar will be sounded; and those who were lost in the land of Ashur ... will come and prostrate themselves before Adonoy on the holy mountain in Yerushalayim.” (Yeshaya 27:13)",
            "10": "10) The shofar reminds us of the future resurrection of the dead and it reaffirms our faith that God will revive the dead which will be heralded with the sounding of the shofar.",
            "11": "This Psalm (47) is recited seven times prior to the sounding of the Shofar. The Name, אלהים, which refers to God’s manifestation, as One Who rules with strict justice, appears in this psalm seven times. Thus we mention the Name אלהים forty-nine times as a prelude to the sounding of the Shofar. Our sages have said that there are forty-nine levels of spiritual impurity before one reaches the lowest depth, from which no salvation is possible. On the other hand, there are forty-nine ascending levels of intellectual sanctity which man can attain. In reciting this psalm we pray for the blast of the Shofar to arouse God’s mercy to overcome His manifestation of strict justice. We also pray for the sound of the shofar to inspire us to climb from the forty-ninth level of spiritual impurity, to rise to the forty-ninth level of sanctity.",

When the Jew hears the broken notes of the teruah, he realizes that he deserves shattering punishment for his transgressions and is inspired to teshuvah, true repentance. His sins are forgiven and this forgiveness is symbolized in the ascendance of Hashem from His Throne of Strict Justice (Elokim) to sit on His Throne of Mercy.

                    "229": "The major portion of the Musaf service, is based on the three concepts: מַלְכֻיּוֹת, namely, that God reigns over the world and we accept His rule; זִכְרוֹנוֹת, that He remembers as He reviews our past; and שׁוֹפָרוֹת, that we are called upon to follow Him into a new future of Torah obedience and fulfillment. These thoughts are impressed upon us in the Musaf service by means of detailed references from the Bible. For each of these three concepts we are given ten Biblical quotations, three from the Torah, three from Sacred Writings, (כְּתוּבִים), and three from the Prophets, (נְבִיאִים). The final quotation is again taken from the Torah; for the Torah is the exclusive, basic source of all Jewish truth, and neither the Writings or the Prophets contain any thought that is not contained in some form in the Torah. Thus these series of quotations both begin and end with quotations from the Torah itself. In keeping with the Talmudic principle, מַעֲלִין בַּקוֹדֶשׁ וְלֹא מוֹרִידִין “that one must always proceed upward and forward, and never backward and downward with respect to things holy,” the quotations from the Writings precede those from the Prophets; for while the Writings are only the product of sacred inspiration, רוּחַ הַקוֹדֶשׁ, the words of the Prophets are the actual, direct, Divine revelation.

In the section dealing with laws of Rosh Hashana (Section 276), he writes, “I found a letter from Rabbi Ephraim of Bonn, in which he wrote that Rabbi Amnon of Mayence authored the וּנְתַנֶּה תֹּקֶף as a result of a tragic incident in his life.” This is the story as recorded in the letter:",
                    "149": "Rabbi Amnon of Mayence, a great scholar, a person of wealth, a handsome man of noble ancestry was under great pressure from the lords and Archbishop of the city to change his faith and adopt their religion. He repeatedly ignored them but on one occasion, in order to put them off, he asked for three days to consider their request. Afterwards he was heartbroken because he had given the impression that he might actually consider renouncing his belief in the One Living God. He refused food or drink; weeping bitterly over his lapse, he refused to accept the sympathy and consolation of friends and relatives.",
                    "150": "At the end of the three days he was summoned by the Archbishop, but he ignored the summons. A distinguished delegation was sent to ask him to appear at the court but he refused them. Finally, he was brought before the court by force, and the Archbishop demanded, “Why did you not come and answer me as you promised?” Rabbi Amnon answered, “As a punishment, you should have my tongue cut out, because my tougue deceived you.” Rabbi Amnon thought to sanctify God’s Name in this manner, since his tongue had uttered such a promise. The Archbishop replied, “No, I will not cut out your tongue for it spoke well, instead, I will cut off your feet for they did not bring you to me.” The tyrant ordered that his hands and feet be cut off in piecemeal fashion; asking him at each interval if he was willing to renounce his faith. He was finally released and sent home with his severed and mutilated limbs aside him in bed.",
                    "151": "The holiday of Rosh Hashana was at hand, and the Rabbi, dying from the effects of his wounds, was at his own request carried into the synagogue, bringing his severed limbs with him. When the Chazzan was about to recite the Kedushah, Rabbi Amnon asked him to stop, saying, “Pause that I may sanctify His Most Holy Name,” and he said in a loud voice: וּבְכֵן וּלְךָ תַעֲלֶה קְדֻשָּׁה, and thus may this sanctification ascend to You, inferring that with his terrible suffering, he had sanctified God’s Name. He then began reciting the וּנְתַנֶּה תֹּקֶף, and with the words אֱמֶת כִּי אַתָּה הוּא דַיָּן וּמוֹכִֽיח, true that You are Judge and Admonisher, he indicated his acceptance of God’s Divine judgment, and with the words וְתִכְתֹּב אֶת גְּזַר דִּינָם, and You recorded the decree of their judgments, he manifested his belief that his fate had been decreed on Rosh Hashana. No sooner had he finished the prayer when he expired. Three days later, he appeared to Rabbi Kolonymus ben Meshullam in a dream and taught him this prayer, asking him to introduce it to all congregations as a testimonial and as a memorial for him. This prayer has formed a portion of our Service ever since.",

The truly pious Jew is concerned only with serving his Creator and his prayers are offered entirely to Hashem. He asks nothing for himself. His prayers are similar to a burnt- offering which is consumed in its entirety on Hashem’s altar. Not every Jew is capable of such a lofty degree of Divine service. Many serve Hashem but are conscious of their own personal needs and desires. Their prayer is thus similar to a שְׁלָמִים, peace offering, of which only part is consumed on the altar, the owner also being permitted to eat and enjoy part of it. We pray that both kinds of prayers be pleasing and acceptable to Hashem, as were the sacrifices on the altar.</i>",

These thoughts are impressed upon us in the Musaf service by means of detailed references from the Bible. For each of these three concepts we are given ten Biblical quotations, three from the Torah, three from Sacred Writings, (כְּתוּבִים), and three from the Prophets, (נְבִיאִים). The final quotation is again taken from the Torah; for the Torah is the exclusive, basic source of all Jewish truth, and neither the Writings or the Prophets contain any thought that is not contained in some form in the Torah. Thus these series of quotations both begin and end with quotations from the Torah itself. In keeping with the Talmudic principle, מַעֲלִין בַּקוֹדֶשׁ וְלֹא מוֹרִידִין “that one must always proceed upward and forward, and never backward and downward with respect to things holy,” the quotations from the Writings precede those from the Prophets; for while the Writings are only the product of sacred inspiration, רוּחַ הַקוֹדֶשׁ, the words of the Prophets are the actual, direct, Divine revelation.

In the section dealing with laws of Rosh Hashana (Section 276), he writes, “I found a letter from Rabbi Ephraim of Bonn, in which he wrote that Rabbi Amnon of Mayence authored the וּנְתַנֶּה תֹּקֶף as a result of a tragic incident in his life.” This is the story as recorded in the letter:",
                    "92": "Rabbi Amnon of Mayence, a great scholar, a person of wealth, a handsome man of noble ancestry was under great pressure from the lords and Archbishop of the city to change his faith and adopt their religion. He repeatedly ignored them but on one occasion, in order to put them off, he asked for three days to consider their request. Afterwards he was heartbroken because he had given the impression that he might actually consider renouncing his belief in the One Living God. He refused food or drink; weeping bitterly over his lapse, he refused to accept the sympathy and consolation of friends and relatives.",
                    "93": "At the end of the three days he was summoned by the Archbishop, but he ignored the summons. A distinguished delegation was sent to ask him to appear at the court but he refused them. Finally, he was brought before the court by force, and the Archbishop demanded, “Why did you not come and answer me as you promised?” Rabbi Amnon answered, “As a punishment, you should have my tongue cut out, because my tougue deceived you.” Rabbi Amnon thought to sanctify God’s Name in this manner, since his tongue had uttered such a promise. The Archbishop replied, “No, I will not cut out your tongue for it spoke well, instead, I will cut off your feet for they did not bring you to me.” The tyrant ordered that his hands and feet be cut off in piecemeal fashion; asking him at each interval if he was willing to renounce his faith. He was finally released and sent home with his severed and mutilated limbs aside him in bed.",
                    "94": "The holiday of Rosh Hashana was at hand, and the Rabbi, dying from the effects of his wounds, was at his own request carried into the synagogue, bringing his severed limbs with him. When the Chazzan was about to recite the Kedushah, Rabbi Amnon asked him to stop, saying, “Pause that I may sanctify His Most Holy Name,” and he said in a loud voice: וּבְכֵן וּלְךָ תַעֲלֶה קְדֻשָּׁה, and thus may this sanctification ascend to You, inferring that with his terrible suffering, he had sanctified God’s Name. He then began reciting the וּנְתַנֶּה תֹּקֶף, and with the words אֱמֶת כִּי אַתָּה הוּא דַיָּן וּמוֹכִֽיח, true that You are Judge and Admonisher, he indicated his acceptance of God’s Divine judgment, and with the words וְתִכְתֹּב אֶת גְּזַר דִּינָם, and You recorded the decree of their judgments, he manifested his belief that his fate had been decreed on Rosh Hashana. No sooner had he finished the prayer when he expired. Three days later, he appeared to Rabbi Kolonymus ben Meshullam in a dream and taught him this prayer, asking him to introduce it to all congregations as a testimonial and as a memorial for him. This prayer has formed a portion of our Service ever since.",

The truly pious Jew is concerned only with serving his Creator and his prayers are offered entirely to Hashem. He asks nothing for himself. His prayers are similar to a burnt- offering which is consumed in its entirety on Hashem’s altar. Not every Jew is capable of such a lofty degree of Divine service. Many serve Hashem but are conscious of their own personal needs and desires. Their prayer is thus similar to a שְׁלָמִים, peace offering, of which only part is consumed on the altar, the owner also being permitted to eat and enjoy part of it. We pray that both kinds of prayers be pleasing and acceptable to Hashem, as were the sacrifices on the altar.</i>",
