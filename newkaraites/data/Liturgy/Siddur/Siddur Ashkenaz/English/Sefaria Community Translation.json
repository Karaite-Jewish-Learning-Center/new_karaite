Praise Him, sun and moon, praise Him, all bright stars. Praise Him, highest heavens, and you waters that are above the heavens. Let them praise the name of the LORD, for it was He who commanded that they be created. He made them endure forever, establishing an order that shall never change. (Psalm 148:1-6)",

For the sake of the unification of the Holy One, blessed be he, and his Presence, through the One that is hidden and concealed, in the name of all Israel!",
                    "2": "One should face east (or Jerusalem) with their feet together as during the Amidah prayer. They should look once at the face of the moon before beginning the blessing, and not look at it again.",

He gave them a time and a decree, that they not change their assigned task. They are joyful and happy to do the will of their Maker, the true worker whose work is truth. He said to the moon to renew itself as a crown of splendor for those born of the womb, those who in the future will renew themselves like it, and as a glorification for their Shaper for the name of his glorious kingdom. Blessed are you, oh Lord, who renews the months.",

Say the following three times while dancing: Just as I dance toward you but am unable to touch you, so too may my enemies be unable to touch me for evil. Say the following three times: Let fall upon them fear and terror! May the greatness of your arm strike them still as stone!

Praise Him with resounding cymbals; praise Him with loud-clashing cymbals. Let all that breathes praise the LORD. Hallelujah. (Psalm 150)",
                    "11": "The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: If the Jewish people merited to greet the Face of their Father in Heaven only one time each and every month, it would suffice for them, since in the blessing of the moon there is an aspect of greeting the Divine Presence. Abaye said: Therefore, we will say the blessing while standing, in honor of the Divine Presence. (Sanhedrin 42a) Who is she that comes up from the desert, Leaning upon her beloved? (Song of Songs 8:5) May it be willed before You, oh Lord, my God and God of my fathers to fill the blemish of the moon so that it should have no longer any smallness. Let the light  of moon be like the light of the sun, like the light of the seven days of creation as it was before its diminution as it says “…the two great lights…” (Genesis 1:16) Let the verse be fulfilled for us as it is written “…and they will seek the LORD their God and David their king…” (Hoshea 3:5) Amen.",

Nations will exult and shout for joy, for You rule the peoples with equity, You guide the nations of the earth. Selah. The peoples will praise You, O God; all peoples will praise You. May the earth yield its produce; may God, our God, bless us. May God bless us, and be revered to the ends of the earth. (Psalm 67)",
                    "13": "We rise to our duty to praise the Master of all, to acclaim the Creator. G-d made our lot unlike that of other people, assigning to us a unique destiny. (For they worship vanity and emptiness, and pray to a god who cannot save.) We bend the knee and bow, acknowledging the Supreme Sovereign, the Holy One, exalted, who spread out the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth, whose glorious abode is in the loftiest heights. This is our G-d; there is no other. In truth, G-d alone is our Ruler, as it is written in the Torah: \"Know this day and take it to heart that Adonai is G-d in heaven above and on earth below; there is no other.\"",
                    "14": "And so we hope in You, Adonai our G-d, soon to see Your splendor: that You will sweep idolatry away so that false gods will be utterly destroyed, and that You will perfect the world by Your sovereignty so that all humanity will invoke Your name, and all the earth's wicked will return to You, repentant. Then all who live will know that to You every knee must bend, every tongue pledge loyalty. To You, Adonai, may all bow in worship. May they give honor to Your glory; may everyone accept Your dominion. Reign over all, soon and for all time. Sovereignty is Yours in glory, now and forever. Thus it is written in Your Torah: \"Adonai reigns for ever and ever.\" Such is the prophetic assurance: \"Adonai shall be acknowledged Ruler of all the earth. On that day Adonai shall be One and G-d's name One.\""
