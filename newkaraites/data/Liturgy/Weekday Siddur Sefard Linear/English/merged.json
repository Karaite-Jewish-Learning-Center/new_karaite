These concepts are the pillars of the Jewish faith. Whenever this sign (°) appears (e.g. בְּכָל֯־לְ֯בָבְךָ), it indicates that you should be careful to pronounce each word distinctly. In many instances, the last letter of the first word and first letter of the second word are the same, the words might be read as one, which is not the proper way to fulfill the mitzvah of Kerias Shema.  </small>",

And in the morning you will see the glory of Adonoy, since He has heard your complaints against Adonoy. But we—what are we that you should complain against us?\"",

The Children of Israel saw it and said to one another, \"What is this?\" For they did not know what it was. Moses said to them, \"This is the bread that Adonoy is giving you to eat.\" \"This is what Adonoy has commanded: Every man shall take as much as he needs for food, an <i>omer</i> per person; according to the number of your souls let each man take for the individuals in his tent.\" The Children of Israel did so; they gathered it, some more, some less. But when then they measured it with an <i>omer,</i> the one who took more did not have extra, and the one who took less was not lacking. Each one had gathered according to his required nourishment. Moses said to them, \"Let jo one leave any of it over until morning.\" But some did not listen to Moses and left part of it over until the morning. It turned wormy and became putrid; and Moses was angry at them; they gathered it each morning, every man according to what he needed. The sun then became hot and it melted.",

Bake what you want to bake, and cook what you want to cook and whatever is left over, put away carefully until morning. They put it away until morning as Moses commanded, and it did not become putrid, and there were no worms in it. Then Moses said, \"Eat it today, for today is Adonoy's Shabbos. Today you will not find [manna] in the field. Six days you shall gather it, but the seventh day is Shabbos; there will be no [manna] on that day.\" But it happened on the seventh day that some of the people went out to gather [manna] but they found nothing.",

Every man must remain in his place; no man may leave his designated place on the seventh day.\" So the people rested on the seventh day. The House of Israel named the food <i>manna.</i> It was like white coriander seed and it tasted like dough kneaded with honey. Moses said, \"This is what Adonoy has commanded, ‘Fill an <i>omer</i> measure with it as a keepsake for your generations, so they will see the food with which I fed you in the wilderness when I took you out of Egypt.\" Moses said to Aaron, \"Take a jar and place an <i>omer</i> full of manna in it, and place it before Adonoy as a keepsake for your generations.\" As Adonoy commanded Moses, so did Aaron place it before the Testimony as a keepsake. The Children of Israel ate the manna for forty years until they came to an inhabited land. They ate the manna until they came to the edge of the land of Canaan.
