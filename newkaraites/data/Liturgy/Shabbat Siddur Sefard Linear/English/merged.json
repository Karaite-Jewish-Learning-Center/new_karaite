All three paragraphs should be read with <i> kavanah,</i> concentrated intention, on what you are saying. The entire Shema should be recited in awe and reverence as it proclaims the existence and unity of God; the Jews' complete dedication to God and His commandments; the belief in Divine justice; the remembrance of the Exodus and the selection of the Jews as God's Chosen People. These concepts are the pillars of the Jewish faith. Whenever this sign (°) appears (e.g. בְּכָלּ־לְּבָבְ֒ךָ), it indicates that you should be careful to pronounce each word distinctly. In many instances, the last letter of the first word and first letter of the second word are the same, the words might be read as one, which is not the proper way to fulfill the mitzvah of Kerias Shema.</small>",

This helps one concentrate on the meaning of this important declaration. Interestingly, the last letter of the first word שְׁמַע and last letter of אֶחָד are written larger than the others. These two letters form the word עֵד “witness”—i.e., every Jew by saying Shema testifies to God’s unity.— Avudraham  Customarily one closes his eyes when pronouncing this testimony in order to shut out all distractions, and to concentrate all one’s thought on God’s unity. The last word, אֶחָד “One,” is to be said with special emphasis, drawing it out for the length of time needed to reflect that God, the Giver and Sustainer of life Whose Providence guides the destinies of all men, is the unique God of Israel, that He is alone in His world, ruling all four corners of the universe.</i>",

Ben Lakish explained that Jacob said “Blessed [is His] Name” in response to his sons’ exclamation. The Sages wondered, “Shall we recite it aloud when our teacher Moses did not say it? Shall we not say it at all, when Jacob ordained it?” Thus the Rabbis enacted that it be said quietly.—Maseches Pesachim 56a. When Moses went up to the heavens, he heard the angels praise God by saying, “Blessed [is His] Name, etc.” When he returned to earth, he taught it to the Jewish People.

Our Sages ordained these three separate forms to signify three kinds of Sabbath—the Sabbath of creation, the Sabbath on which the Torah was given at Sinai, and the Sabbath of the World to Come. Thus at Maariv, we say “ אַתָּה קִדַשְׁתָּ , You have sanctified the Seventh day—the climax of making heaven and earth” commemorating the Sabbath of creation. At Shacharis, we say, “ יִשְׂמַח משֶה Moses will rejoice in the gift . . . when he stood before You on Mount Sinai”—to commemorate the giving of the Torah. And at Mincha we say, “ אַתָּה אֶחָד , You are One,” to remind us of the Sabbath of the World-to-Come where indeed it will be revealed to all that He is One.— Siach Yitzchok Moses “Will” rejoice—the future tense is used to indicate that after the resurrection of the dead, in the World-to-Come, Moses will rejoice triply with all aspects of the Sabbath.—Metzudas Yehoshua</i>",

The truly pious Jew is concerned only with serving his Creator and his prayers are offered entirely to God. He asks nothing for himself. His prayers are similar to a burnt-offering which is consumed in its entirety on God’s altar. Not every Jew is capable of such a lofty degree of Divine service. Many serve God but are conscious of their own personal needs and desires. Their prayer is thus similar to a שְׁלָמִים , peace offering, of which only part is consumed on the altar, the owner also being permitted to eat and enjoy part of it. We pray that both kinds of prayers be pleasing and acceptable to God, as were the sacrifices on the altar.</i>",
