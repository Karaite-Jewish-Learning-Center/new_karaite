Cheese produced by a non-Jew is permitted, since milk of a non-kosher animal cannot become cheese. However, in the days of the sages, they decreed that cheese produced by a non-Jew be prohibited, lest they coagulate it using the non-kosher stomach lining of animals they slaughter. And if you will say - the stomach-lining is negligible in relation in the amount of milk; should it not be considered nullified? Since it is the very thing which creates the cheese, and if the thing which creates the cheese is prohibited, the whole thing is prohibited, as will be explained.",

[Regarding] the butter of non-Jews, some of the Geonim permit it, for [the Sages] did not make a decree against butter, and impure milk [from a non-kosher animal] will not coagulate [into the butter]. But some of the Geonim prohibit it, because of the drops of milk that remain in it. For the whey in the butter is not mixed into the butter in such a way as to be nullified based on its minimal quantity. And we suspect all milk from them [non-Jews], lest it be mixed with the milk of an impure [non-kosher] animal.",

If you would say [that drops of non-kosher milk] were mixed with [the butter] and they were all cooked together, [the non-kosher milk drops] would be nullified based on their minimal quantity. But [if] the butter was cooked by non-Jews, it is forbidden because of the leeching of non-Jewish [vessels into food], as will be explained."

Still, the laws of <i>neta revai</i> do not apply, as will be explained in [the section of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> titled] <i>Hilkhot Ma'aser Sheni</i>. [Thus, in other places] outside of Israel [where neither the law of tithes or the laws of the sabbatical year apply], how much the moreso should <i>neta revai</i> not apply. In the land of Israel, however, [these laws] operate whether inside or outside of the Temple.

The reason is, as is written [in Lev. 19:25], \"And in the fifth year, you shall eat its produce.\" The only intent of this written [verse] is that in the fifth year, you shall eat its produce without redeeming it like all other non-consecrated [produce] in the world.
