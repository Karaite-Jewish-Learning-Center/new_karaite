And if one said \"give me my portion from this side so that it will be adjacent to another field of mine and it will all be one [adjoined] field\" - he is listened to, and he can force him on this, for blocking of this [type of] matter [of benefit to one with no harm to another] is the nature of Sodom.  But if one portion was better [quality land] or nearer to a river or near the road, and they evaluated the better [portion] relative to the worse [portion]. and he said \"give to me according to my estimate from this side [of the field] - he is not listened to - rather he takes according to drawn lots.  [If] he said \"Give me half its measured size from the inferior side without appraisal and you take from the better side, so that my portion will abut my field, some of the Gaonim instructed that we listen to him [and force the other to agree]. And according to this [ruling] my own mind is inclined [accordingly], and so is fitting to rule."
