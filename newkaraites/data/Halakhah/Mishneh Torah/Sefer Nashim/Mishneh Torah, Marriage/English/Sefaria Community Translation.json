Once the Torah was given, Israel was commanded that if a man wanted to marry a woman, he would acquire her first through witnesses, and afterwards she would be his wife, as it says, \"When a man takes a woman and comes (sleeps with) to her...\" (Deuteronomy 22:13).",

Marriage through intercourse and by contract is from the Torah, and by money is Rabbinical [lit. \"the words of the Scribes\"]. And this acquisition is what is called \"Kiddushin\" or \"Eirusin\" in several places. And a woman who is acquired through one of these three means is called a \"Mekudeshet\" or \"Meureset\"."

There are others who teach that we determine her maintenance on the presumption that she did not receive [payment from her husband] or waive [payment]. [Therefore,] she needn't bring [forth] her <i>ketubah</i>. I incline toward [the latter] with regard [to a woman] whose husband left, since her [claim to] maintenance [comes from] the Torah [itself]. But if her husband died, she is not [entitled to] maintance until she brings her <i>ketubah</i>, because she receives maintenance due to an enactment of the rabbis. Additionally, [her maintenance] is pained from the property of [the husband's] heirs, and [a court] always [privileges] claims of heirs."

However, if he is involved in Torah and engrossed in it, and he fears that if he marries, he will have to busy himself with supporting a wife and thereby come to neglect Torah study, then it is permissible for him to delay [marriage]; for one who is involved in a mitzva is exempt from another mitzva â€“ all the more so regarding Torah study.",

Therefore, the presumption is that he has heard [of any blemish] and accepted [it]. It does not appear to me that such a ruling [is correct], as no man will reveal all that is in his heart in these matters to [people who are] not his relatives.
