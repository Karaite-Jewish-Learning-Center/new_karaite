And we do not appoint to the Sanhedrin, except for priests, Levites and Israelites of well-known lineage who can marry into the priesthood, as it written,  \"And they will stand there with you(Numbers 11:16).\" They should resemble you in wisdom, reverence and lineage.",

These are them: wisdom, humility, fear of Heaven, dislike of money, love of truth, are loved by their fellow man, have a good name.  All of these traits are explicit in the Torah.",

Therefore, if his adversary complained about him, and brought him to Beit Din, and they researched and found that he did appropriately and judged truthfully, we do not overturn his verdict."

We hide witnesses to observe his act. He does not need a warning as must be given to others who are executed. If he departed from the court after being acquitted, and someone said: \"I know a rationale that will lead to his conviction,\" he is returned and retried. If he was sentenced to death and someone said: \"I know a rationale that will lead to his release,\" he is not retried. The court does not advance arguments in defense of a mesit. An elderly person, a eunuch, and a person who does not have sons are placed on the court which judges him, so that they will not have mercy on him. For cruelty to those who sway the people after emptiness brings mercy to the world, as implied by Deuteronomy 13:19: \"so that God will turn away from His fierce anger and grant you mercy.\""

I will then construct the argument correctly, so that the judgment will be quoted in my name\"? The Torah therefore says, \"Distance yourself from falsehood.\"",
            "3": "It is a Mitzvah to tell the parties at the beginning 'do you want Din (strict justice), or Pesharah (arbitration)?' If they want Pesharah, we seek out a compromise for them. A court that always does Pesharah is praiseworthy. Of them the verse says, “A just peace was made in your gates.” What kind of peace is also justice? We must conclude that this is Pesharah. As it is stated regarding King David, “And David made justice and righteousness to the nation.” What is the justice that has with it righteousness? We must conclude that it is arbitration.  This is before the verdict, even if you heard their words and know which way the verdict leans. Once the case finished, and he said “Ploni, you are innocent, and Almoni, you are liable,” you may not do Pesharah, rather, let the Din pierce the mountain."

It may destroy those funds or give them to whomever they see fit to close any breaches in the faith and to strengthen its observance or to penalize a stubborn and difficult person. The Book of Ezra 10:8 states: \"Whoever fails to come in three days according to the advice of the officers and the elders will have all of his property confiscated.\" From this we learn that when a court declares property ownerless, their declaration is effective."
