Any court has the authority to suspend the law in an emergency. How so? A court that determines that to strengthen the law/religion and to make a fence so that the masses do not violate Torah law, has the authority to flog [offenders] without warrant authorized by positive law. But they do not establish this [deflection] from positive statute in permanence and do not declare that such and such is the law. And similarly, if they [the members of the court] determine to nullify [le-batel] a positive commandment or to transgress a negative commandment in order to cause the masses to return to law/religion or to prevent the majority of Israel from stumbling [i.e., sinning] in other [similarly serious] matters, [the court] does so [suspend the positive law]. For just as the doctor amputates a limb or foot in order that a patient survives, similarly, the court rules at any time to transgress a few commandments for a term in order that the masses may one day return and fulfil [all] the commandments. Thus, any court may rule, at any time [zeman min ha-zemanim], to violate some commandments temporarily, in order to sustain them all [i.e., all of the commandments], as was commanded40 by the early sages, violate one Sabbath so that one may observe many Sabbaths."

When he disputes any law of the laws with the large beit din, and does not rescind his words in favor of the decision of the beit din, rather he continues to argue against them and continues to teach and to act against their decision, the Torah has decreed upon him death.  If he confesses, he has a place in the World to Come.  Even though he is a judge and they are judges and he has received the tradition just as they have, the Torah has given them the measure of honor.  If the beit din wanted to forego their honor and let him live, they may not, so that disputes will not be plentiful among the people Israel.",
