                "2": "From the laws of the commandment is that which they, may their memories be blessed, said (Sotah 41a, Mishneh Torah, Laws of Festival Offering 3:3) that the king was the one that was obligated to read it in their ears. And he would read it in the women's yard [of the Temple]. And he reads while sitting, but if he read while standing, behold that is praiseworthy. And from where does he read? From the beginning of the book of Eleh HaDevarim (Deuteronomy) until the end of the section of Shema Yisrael (Deuteronomy 6:9), and he skips to Vehaya im shamo'ah and finishes that section (Deuteronomy 11:13-21), and [then] skips to Aser te'aser (Deuteronomy 14:22) and reads from Aser te'aser, according to [its proper] order, until the end of the blessings and curses, up until \"besides for the covenant which He made with them in Chorev\" (Deuteronomy 28:69), and stops."
