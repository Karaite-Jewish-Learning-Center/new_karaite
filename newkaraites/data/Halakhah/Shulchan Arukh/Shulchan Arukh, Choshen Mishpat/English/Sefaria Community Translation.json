The Geonim instituted that for such a case we accept testimony not in front of the parties and we do not reveal the identity of the witnesses. It seems to me that this is only where the court does not want to judge strict law and punish, but instead wants to quiet the fighting and rule based on the needs of the particular dispute.

Similarly, if there is a pressing need and it is impossible to accept the testimony later, such as where the witnesses or plaintiff were sick and in danger of dying or where the witnesses are going overseas and we cannot wait to tell him, we may accept even without sending for him.

The same applies where he located his witnesses in another city and there is no time to send for the other party or they will not be able to find them again. The court may accept the testimony not in front of the parties, and judge based on that testimony. This is the widespread custom in our countries, notwithstanding the fact that there are those that argue and hold one cannot accept testimony not in front of the parties if they did not send for the party first, even in a situation where there is a concern that the testimony will be lost if they insist on accepting in front of the party.

Similarly, if Reuven sold or bequeathed the stolen field to Levi and Yehuda brings a claim against Levi, Shimon cannot testify that it does not belong to Yehuda. If Shimon sold the stolen garment to Levi, Shimon gave up on reclaiming it and Yehuda brings a claim against Levi, Shimon may testify that it is not Yehuda’s if Reuven had died because this garment will never go back to Shimon since the buyer already acquired it with the giving up of hope and the transfer of possession and Reuven the thief had died, so there is no one to collect the money from. If, however, Reuven was still alive, Shimon may not even testify on the garment because there is a benefit to him for the garment not to go to Yehuda so that he can bring a proof that Reuven stole it and Reuven will have to pay. Similarly, if the garment was in the possession of Reuven’s inheritors, Shimon may not testify because it will eventually go back to Shimon if the inheritors can maintain possession. The same applies to anything similar. Even in a case where Reuven died, Shimon may only testify if the sale was unsecured.

If, however, the work involves an immediate loss - e.g., he hired the workers to remove flax from the vat, or he hired a donkey to bring flutes for a funeral or for a wedding or the like - neither a worker nor a contractor may retract (a maid or a servant of the employer considered an immediate loss since the employer is not able to do the work himself, therefore he suffers a loss) unless he is held back by forces beyond his control -e.g., he became ill (him or his wife or his children) or he heard that a close relative died. (However the employer does not have to pay the full wage, but only for their work, they {the workers} have the upper hand. If the employer re-employees the workers after the circumstance is over without specifying anything, and they come back to do their job then he pays them in full and does not deduct anything. If not, then the employer deducts all the sick or unfortunate days, even though he didn't back out. The same ruling is for a teacher who fell ill, you deduct the sick days. However if the worker or teacher already received their payment then some say that he does not have to return. A teacher who backs out is considered 'immediate loss' the same applies to a scribe who accepted to write a book and backed out in the middle, is considered 'immediate loss'. Teachers are classified like other workers who need to act as is customary to start and to finish work, as explained in Siman 331. He is prohibited from doing other work while he is teaching or to stay up at night excessively or to minimize or add in food, and whoever changes has the 'lower hand' and is removed. A teacher who was hired for a set period of time has the laws of a worker.

If the worker is not held back by forces beyond his control, and he retracts, the owner may hire others on their account or deceive them. (If he found other workers to hire and he deceived the original workers then he has to pay them based on his last agreement.) What is meant by deceiving them? He tells them: \"I agreed to pay you a sela; take two so that you will complete your work.\" Afterwards, he is not required to give them anything more than he originally agreed.

For their entire wage. Moreover, if they have money that is in the employer's possession, the employer can use that money to hire workers to complete their work until he pays each worker 40 or 50 zuz a day although he originally hired the worker at three or four zuz. (If the employer does not hire other worker's on the expense of the first workers, then they are not responsible to pay for the damage. Some say, be is nly allowed to hire new workers on the previous ones expense, up to 40 or 50 zuz, is only if the employer has their tools, but nothing else.
