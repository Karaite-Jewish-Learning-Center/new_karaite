And when it came to pass, when the Creator came to the twentieth year, and a yellow gate grew, and he awoke to me, as a man who wakes up his throne, and says unto my soul, How long shall the wicked daughter evade, How long will you be taken away from your hands? Every day he healed the altar of the destroyed God. And when she heard the loud voice of the call, she said, \"I will come and go in the streets and streets in the city, to ask me for rest, and I will hear a voice from the desert, a city and a Kaddish from heaven.\" My master, Rabbi Elkabetz Halevi, came down and said to me, \"My son will support me.\" I will listen to my words and listen to His words, and he will instruct me to learn my ways of caution, and I will open my gates to him, and I will strengthen myself, because my brother will deal with days and their wonders and say what is good and what is pleasant to be.

We saw the portion of the scroll, which was divided into thirty-two parts, and was imprinted in the name of Sha'arim as being the gates to enter the inner sanctuaries of the Torah and its secrets. Chapter and chapter, and we recover the spring from the spring If we do not give him the keys and the gates of the gates, for God will grant him harm and not benefit, and whoever has given him the keys to a lesson that can open our gates, we are sure that he will open several gates in our gates. Do not ask him to take a look at things two times. He will travel from the chapter until we know that what he will need from his education will not come back but relies on what we have already written in the previous chapter and will not move his legs from this gate to others until he is properly disposed of and then go safely through him and not be afraid so we will not collect our hands from Lavar as we wrote in some place or as we will explain In a certain place, these are the names of the gates: a man on his flag in letters:"
