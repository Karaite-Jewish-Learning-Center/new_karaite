The first inquiry is that which the first- and the last ones inquired to know the reason of the creation of the worlds. This reason has been counted, finished and developed. It is said that this reason of the matter is that the Blessed One \"needs\" to be complete in all His actions and abilities and in all His Names of greatness and loftiness and honor. "

For there are those that wrote that the Ten Sefirot are according to ten levels one after the other and one lower than another. And there are those who write that their order is straight up with a border or division between right and left and middle: 3 Sefirot one next to the other on the right side - Chochmah, Chesed, Netzach; 3 Sefirot one next to the other on the left side - Binah, Gevurah, Hod; and 4 Sefirot one next to the other in the middle - Keter, Tiferet, Yesod, Malchut. Many learned and said that they are in the shape/form of wheels, circling around one under the other, and one surrounding another. Behold, one who looks at the words of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai in the Zohar and the Tikkunim, and also in the Sefer HaBahir {the Book of Splendor} (written by Rabbi Nechunia ben Hakanah) will find in their words many different lessons which are inclined to here or there. The later Mekubalim {Kabbalists} (who were perplexed by this) greatly tired of investigating this and were not able to do so. Because a great and strong problem/difficulty came upon them like a storm, as was said before, that the Ein Sof differed according to each opinion; and a complete comparison could not be justified either up or down, facing or backwards. All of these established  teachers had boundaries and borders and areas of measuring the Light of the Heavenly Ein Sof, G-d forbid. And it was known that the Light of Ein Sof is fundamental and was embedded within the thickness of each and every Sefirah, and is measured in each and every Sefirah...as is remembered in the Zohar Parshat Behar, and Parshat Pinchas and in the introductions to the Tikkunim...
