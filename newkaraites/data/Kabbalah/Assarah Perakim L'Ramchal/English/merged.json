            "1": "The O\"S, how so? This is what is written: \"I form the light, and I create darkness; I make peace, and I create evil\" (Isaiah 45:7). Form light, this is the right [side]; create darkness, this is the left side. Make peace, those are the angles of peace. And create evil, this is Samael. Angels of peace, ten groups [of them] serve the ten sefirot of the right [side]. Angels of destruction, ten degrees/ranks [of them] serve the ten sefirot of the left side. On them it is said: \"And also this, opposite to this, Elokim made\" (Ecclesiastes 7:14).",
            "2": "Four degrees, four husks, worlds of Samael, block the light of the sefirot, and defray them with the deeds of the lower ones, they come - G-d forbid! - and do evil, in the world of Noga, a great cloud, and fire that bursts, and wind of tempest; since this is explained through Ezekiel's Vaera (Ezekiel 28:25-29:21)",
            "3": "Four husks, four worlds to twenty-one of them, in them ten sefirot in five faces, that the fixings (tikunim) of the lower ones are in four worlds, and their defects in four worlds. If the lower ones merit, the Lord leads with mercy, and the guard goes from in front of him (away). If they sinned, the Master of Mercy separates himself, and the guard does justice on the guilty ones. With the separation of the Lord, the deed of the guard, is what is written: \"And the anger of Hashem flared against them, and He went away, and the cloud departed from over the tent, and behold Miriam was leprous as snow\" (Numbers 12:10).",
            "4": "The order of the judgments, those are the roots of the husk, from they overpower her, and from them they raise her, according to the deeds of the lower ones, this is what the Writing says: \"And you shall guard My decrees and My ordinances, that a person shall do and live by them\" (Leviticus 18:5)"

Ch\"y [chayah and yechidah] from Atzilut. Neshamah from Briah. Ruach from Yetzirah. Nefesh from Asyah. The force of a human being is found from malchut of asyah until the keter of atzilut. This is why it is written: \"Let us make the Human in Our image as Our Character and they shall rule over the fish-creatures of the sea\" (Genesis 1:26).",

How so? the work of the Neshamah is 613 mitzvot, their completion leads to the resting of the soul, and if not, she comes back and is reincarnated, and she does not reincarnate whole, just the parts that need fixing.",
            "2": "What is reincarnation and what is intercalation? Reincarnation is from the moment of birth to the moment of death; intercalation can come every \"hour\", and can leave every \"hour\". A mitzvah in which the soul is obligated to fulfill happens in a reincarnation, and one that the soul is not obligated to fulfill happens in an intercalation, from the moment is is fulfilled it [the intercalation] is gone. Righteous [people/souls] can reincarnate a thousand [times], evil [people/souls] up to four, as it is written \"and to the fourth I will not make her return\"(Amos 1:3).",
            "3": "The nefesh comes at the beginning, and after it the ruach, and after it the neshamah, and chayah and yechidah after them. All souls [neshamah] have a cloak. The nefesh reincarnates by herself, and the ruach by herself, and the neshamah by herself. And souls [neshamot] ride the cloaks of others. The souls are not all equal, since the new ones are not like the old ones, and the ones that reincarnate for the first time and not like the ones which experienced reincarnation twice, and on all He says: \"And they are turned round about by His guidance, that they may do\" (Job 37:12). And He says: \"and let Him devise means, that he that is banished be not an outcast from Him\" (II Samuel 14:14). And He says: \"Every one that is called by My name, and whom I have created for My glory, I have formed him, yea, I have made him.\" (Isaiah 43:7). And He says: \"Hashem will reign forever\" (Exodus 15:18). And He says: \"And all your people are righteous, they shall inherit the land for ever; the branch of My planting, the work(s) of My hands, wherein I glory\" (Isaiah 60:21)."
