            "1": "I saw ascenders (mystical students), and they were few, craving to ascend, and the ladder was hidden from their eyes, and they contemplated the primordial books, to seek and find ways of life, the path they would go and the work that they would do, to raise their souls to its lofty root, and to cleave to the Blessed One, for he is the permanent wholeness in the same way as the prophets (OR that is the fulfillment of Netzach - one of the qabbalistic pillars of prophecy - in the way of the prophets), for all their days they were cleaved to their creator, and by this cleaving she, the Holy Spirit, ministered to them, to teach them what is the way they would bring down (lit. seat) light, to light up their eyes with the secrets of Torah, as David the King, peace be upon him, prayed, \"uncover my eyes and I will behold wonder from your Torah,\" and to teach them the right path, to go to the city dwelling prepared from them with the ascenders, and after them came the first Hasidim, called \"Separated ones,\" and they sought to follow on the heels of prophets and their circles, and to imitate them, in the rocky caves and wildernesses, and they separated themselves from the ways of human beings, and some of them cloistered in their houses as if they were in the wilderness, all day and all night continually and unceasing, praising their creator with immersion in Torah, and with songs of David the King peace be upon him, which are gladdening to the heart, until it [the heart] would cleave their contemplations with strength and vigorous zeal to the supernal lights. They continued like this all their days, until the ascended to the rung of the Holy Spirit, and they prophesied and did not cease, as Targum Onqelos says, \"and they did not break.\" And even though each individuals experience was different, we have not found a guideline or handbook which describes how these holy ones served Hashem Yisborach in order that we can too:",
            "2": "Therefore, the hearts have been weakened, as have the knowledge, of the generations that follow, and no longer are there masters of Divine Inspiration. They traveled to their resting places (passed away), and left us sighing, hungry and thirsty, until despair as grown within man [holding them] from seeking this awesome wisdom. And if a few grains can be found within the bushes, one in a city or two in a family, who seek out water and it is not found, because all vision has been blocked, for sole reason that a practical guide has not been written to approach the holy and enter:",
            "3": "There were also those who would make oaths with the power of holy names of angels, they hoped for light but behold darkness, because they were very low-level angels, who were appointed on the work of this world, and they are composed of good and evil, they themselves [the angels] will not grasp the truth and the supernal lights, rather they reveal to them mixed up revelations, [a mixture of] good and evil, truth and falsehood, false healing techniques, alchemy, sorcery, actions through charms, and oaths. These people (are likened to those who) have gone wrong with wine, and astray with beer. If only their hearts would have brought them to toil in torah and mitzvos. They should have learned from the concept of \"kal v'chomer\" (all the more so) from the 4 great leaders of Israel who entered the Pardes (lit. garden - the upper realms) and not one was spared except for the great \"saba kadisha\" holy one Rabi Akivah (and even him, the ministering angels tried the harm him, if not for Hashems help), he entered in peace and left in peace:",
            "4": "The truth is, that they sought high levels, close to prophecy, and therefore took risks. However, for us, if only we would merit a small amount (low-level) of Ruach Hakodesh, like the revelation of Elija the Prophet z\"l, who many have merited, as is known, and (the level of) revelation of the souls of tzaddikim, as is mentioned many times in the tikunim (tikunei hazohar). Not only that (not only in the times of the zohar), but even in this day and age I've seen holy people who have attained all this. There are those for whom their own awesome soul, through extreme purification, would be revealed to them, and will guide him in all his ways. And all of these close paths can be attained even in this day and age to those who are fit for them. However, a person needs to go through many tests, trials, and tribulations, to come to the Truth, because perhaps a strange and impure would come to him (while he thinks it is pure and true). All that will be explained in the third part of this book in the eighth gate:",
            "5": "Therefore, the spirit of my soul has justified for me to permit [this wisdom] to the separated ones, to support their struggle, to teach them the path. With that intent I put together this book, it's small in quantity but great in quality, the wise will be enlightened. I called the book \"Shaarei Kedusha\" the Gates of Holiness, in it I will reveals secrets, that the generations before us did not lay out, for I have received all this from the mouth of a holy man, an angel of God, my master the Ari Luria z\"l (Arizal). But since they are the secrets of the world, and hidden wonders, I will reveal and handsbreath but conceal 2000 amot (about a km), I will force open (or barely open) the gates of holiness, a crack the size of a needle, and whoever is fit will merit entering deeply within. Hashem who is Good will not hold back good from those who walk with sincerity.    ",
            "6": "Its partition is four parts:",
            "7": "The First Part, instruction on the path of Hassidut and Pirshut (Interpretation), which is brought about by the agency of the Holy Spirit, and it is further divided into six gates. The Second Part, rebukes, and elucidation of the punishment and the reward for positive and negative mitzvot (commandments), and it is divided into seven gates. The Third Part, instruction on attainment to the Holy Spirit itself, and it is divided into eight gates. The Fourth Part, the operations of yichudim (unifications) themselves, whereby one will attain to the Holy Spirit, which I have examined, tried and perfected on my own.",
            "9": "The First Part is divided into six gates. The first, to make known the enormity  of the defect caused by human sin relative to the mitzvot. The second, how the defect is perpetuated by various middot (emotional characteristics or intelligences). The third, explanation of a righteous or beloved name. The fourth, explanation of the level of the tzaddiq (righteous person, saint) in detail. The fifth, explanation of the level of the hasid (beloved or loyal person) in detail. The sixth, a very brief explanation of the meditation of hasids, summarizing each of the gates which are in this part.",

Whenever any one of them is overpowered by the bad that is in them, according to the corresponding good that is within them, then sicknesses and plagues afflict the human being, and if it is overpowered too much, the human body will die.
