                "0": "1. Since G-d is not confined to time and space or any other limitations, Kabbalah refers to Him as <i>Ayn Sof </i>- The Infinite. As He is infinite and boundless, so is the power of His Will.",
                "1": "2. The prohibition against the contemplation of G-d's essence is widely known. Whatever is related about G-d pertains only to His Will and providence, which are manifest by His actions. This general rule applies to all Kabbalah, as stated by Rabbeinu Moshe Chaim Luzzatto in his book Adir Bamarom, \"It is self evident that any expression regarding the Emanator, Blessed Be He, refers only to His actions rather than His essence.\"",
                "2": "3. There are ten <i>Sefirot </i>by which G-d, Blessed Be He, creates and conducts the worlds. They Are:<br>1. <i>Keter </i>- Crown,<br>2. <i>Chochmah </i>- Wisdom,<br>3. <i>Binah </i>- Understanding,<br>4. <i>Chessed </i>- Kindness,<br>5. <i>Gevurah </i>- Might,<br>6. <i>Tiferet </i>- Beauty,<br>7. <i>Netzach </i>- Victory,<br>8. <i>Hod </i>- Majesty,<br>9. <i>Yesod </i>- Foundation,<br>10. <i>Malchut </i>- Kingdom.",
                "3": "4. The <i>Sefirot </i>are those divine faculties which G-d utilizes to create and conduct the worlds.",
                "4": "5. G-d governs the world with three general modes of conduct; Pure Kindness - <i>Chessed</i>, Pure Judgment - <i>Din</i>, and the median conduct of Mercy - <i>Rachamim</i>.",
                "5": "6. <i>Keter </i>influences great and unbounded kindness and mercy without discerning the merit of the recipient. This is because <i>Keter </i>represents G-d's ultimate intention in creation, that is to benefit All, as the Talmud states on the verse, \"I will be gracious to whomever I will be gracious,\" - even to the unworthy.",
                "6": "7. Chochmah, too, is free of Judgement, influencing the world with great kindness including the unworthy, but, not to the extent of Keter. The quality of Binah is kindness as well, yet to a lesser degree. This is because judgments begin to arise in Binah, as mentioned in the blessing: \"Who gives the rooster the understanding (Binah) to discern (Judgment) between day and night,\" - For sometimes, in order to prevent anarchy, G-d excercises judgment upon the world, so that evil, though a necessary component in creation for the purpose of choise, not be left unchecked. This judgment, in truth, is a kindness to the world. Moreover, kindness may be the motivating factor of severity, as scripture states, \"For whom the L-rd loves, He corrects,\" and, \"As a man chastens his son so does the L-rd your G-d chasten you.\"",
                "7": "8. Keter, Chochmah, and Binah are called the first or upper three sefirot. When any of these are revealed, it is a time of great mercy and goodwill toward the world. They reflect G-d's ultimate intention in the world, unobstructed by the deeds of man.",
                "8": "9. Chesed is Pure Kindness, though only to the meritorious, as is the reward of the righteous in Gan Eden. Gevurah is Pure Judgment and retribution to the guilty, as is the punishment of the wicked in Genhenom. Tiferet is the median conduct of Mercy, between Chesed and Gevurah, but inclines more toward Kindness than Judgment.",
                "9": "10. Netzach is Kindness tempered with Judgment, for example, sometimes the righteous suffer in this world for their few errors, to be ultimately rewarded in the world to come - the seemingly negative being ultimately positive.",
                "10": "11. Hod is Judgment tempered with Kindness, for example, sometimes the wicked prosper in this world for their few virtues, to be ultimately destroyed in the world to come, as scripture states, \"He pays his enemy up front to destroy him,\" - the seemingly positive being ultimately negative. Yesod is the median conduct between Netzach and Hod, tempered by both, but inclining more toward Judgment than Kindness. The world is generally conducted through this faculty.",
                "11": "12. The six sefirot (Chesed, Gevurah, Tiferet, Netzach, Hod, and Yesod) are collectively called the System of Justice in that they are responsive to human deeds, for even Chesed, which is pure kindness, applies only to the meritorious.",
                "12": "13. Keter is called <i>Arich Anpin </i>- Patient, because it represents unqualified mercy, which will only be fully realized in the world to come. (This gives the righteous the opportunity to acquire greater merit, and the wicked the chance to repent.) The six sefirot are called <i>Zeir Anpin </i>- Short Tempered, because they represent the qualified system of justice by which the world is presently being conducted.",
                "13": "14. Malchut is the medium for Divine providence through which the kingdom of G-d and his presence - <i>Shechinah, </i>will be realized and accepted by All. This sefirah has a dual function; it is a conduit that accepts mans good deeds and prayers, and responds by transmitting divine influence upon them.",
                "14": "15. The term Sefirot means Numbers - Mispar. The concept of sefirot can therefore be applied to many matters. Everything that exists can be divided into ten sefirot.",
                "15": "16. Scripture states: \"All the hosts of heaven stand by Him to His right and to His left.\" The sages asked, \"And are there right and left above? Rather, the right for virtue and the left for guilt.\" Therefore, a sefirah which influences Kindness to the worthy is allegorically considered \"right\" and one which influences Judgment upon the guilty is allegorically considered \"left\".",
                "16": "17. A diagram of the sefirot conveying this concept would therefore appear thus: Keter in the top center position, since it is the root of all. Under it, Chochmah to the right and Binah to the left, since in Binah descernments begin to arise. Under them Chesed to the Right and Gevurah to the left, with the median conduct of Tiferet centered below. Below them, Netzach to the right and Hod to the left, with the median conduct of Yesod centered below. Under Yesod, in the center, Malchut which recieves from All.",
                "17": "18. This diagram is allegorically called the Ten Upright Sefirot - <i>Esser Sefirot D'Yosher.</i>",
                "18": "19. There is also a diagram of concentric circles in which Keter encompasses Chochmah, which in turn encompasses Binah, etc., with Malchut at its center. This diagram is called the Ten Sefirot of Circles - <i>Esser Sefirot D'Igulim</i>. It conveys principles in the development of the worlds one from the other, and indicates that the more essential the conduct, the more all encompassing it is. But, when the subject is the divine system of conduct, the quality of its various modes and their interrelationships, the diagram of the ten upright sefirot is used. (The GR\"A states that the circular sefirot indicate general providence and the upright sefirot, individual providence.)",
                "19": "20. Malchut is more severe than the six sefirot of Zeir Anpin, which represent the system of justice. For since Malchut is called \"Righteous Judgment\", it is more exacting. Only at times, through the merit of mankind does Malchut join Chesed (Kindness) resulting in Rachamim (Mercy).",
                "20": "21. A general conduct which is an expression of judgment, such as Malchut, is allegorically considered female. This is one reason that Malchut is often called <i>Nukve</i> (Female).",
                "21": "22. Binah is somewhat severe relative to Chochmah, since discernments begin to arise in it. Therefore, it too, is considered female. Accordingly, in kabbalistic terminology, when the judgmental aspect of a particular sefirah is mentioned, the feminine gender is used. For example, \"<i>Arich Anpin </i>and his Female\", refers to Keter, which is the quality of absolute mercy, and the potential judgment dormant in it. Gevurah and Hod, though they are expressions of judgment, are not generally considered female. This is because they are integral components in the reward and punishment of the System of Judgment - <i>Zeir Anpin</i>, and do not function independently of it.",
                "22": "23. The sefirot have both revealed and concealed aspects. The revealed is considered external, and the concealed, internal. An example of the concealed aspect is a kindness done in secrecy in which the kindness or goodness is not recognized, as stated in Proverbs: \"Good is a revealed rebuke coming from a hidden love,\" and as stated in Talmud, \"The recipient of a miracle does not recognize it as such.\"",
                "23": "24. Sometimes instead of Keter, Daat is enumerated amongst the sefirot. The GR\"A explained that the inclusion of Keter reflects the inner aspect, while the inclusion of Daat, reflects the external aspect.",
                "24": "25. This is because the quality of Keter - Great Mercy is not presently revealed. It will only be fully realized in the world to come. This is indicated by the divine name E-H-EY- E-H - \"I will be,\" in the future tense, meaning, \"I am destined to be\" - after the six thousandth year of creation. Since the conduct toward the world is preparatory to G-d's ultimate intent of benefiting all, Keter, though concealed, is its underlying and motivating force, as stated in the Talmud, \"Everything that the Merciful One does is for the good.\" For this reason, Keter is only counted in respect to the hidden inner aspect but regarding the external aspect, Daat is counted instead, since it represents that minute revelation of Keter in this world, on a lesser level. It is, therefore, centered under Chochmah (which is free of Judgment) and Binah (in which discernments begin to arise) being a median conduct between them.",
                "25": "26. All that is revealed and is known to us of Keter is that this world is preparatory to its revelation in the world to come. Accordingly, Keter is the root of all present conducts since it was G-d's original intent to reveal Keter through them - \"The last deed being in the first thought.\"",
                "26": "27. This explains the above statement that Keter is counted regarding the inner aspect, but regarding the external aspect, Daat is counted instead, and Keter is only considered the root. Keter is therefore called <i>Ayn </i>- Nothingness and <i>Raysha D'Ayn </i>- The Primal Nothingness, because we comprehend almost nothing of it. Accordingly, the GR\"A states that, \"revelation begins with Chochmah.\" The order of the sefirot would then be: Chochmah, Binah, Daat, Chesed, etc.",
                "27": "28. Thus, since the revealed aspect begins with Chochmah and Binah, they are called Father and Mother - <i>Abba V'Ima, </i>for since discernments begin to arise in Binah, it is considered female.",
                "28": "29. The sefirot can therefore be categorized into five general modes of conduct (<i>Partzufim</i>): <i>Arich Anpin </i>- Patient, for Keter, <i>Abba </i>- Father, for Chochmah, <i>Ima </i>- Mother, for Binah, <i>Zeir Anpin </i>- Short Tempered, for the six sefirot Chesed, Gevurah, Tiferet, Netzach, Hod, and Yesod (which collectively constitute the System of Justice, and, <i>Nukvah </i>- The Female, for Malchut.",
                "29": "30. Sometimes the ten sefirot are categorized as the five kindnesses and the five severities. The five kindnesses are: Keter, Chochmah, Chesed, Tiferet, (since it inclines toward kindness), and, Netzach. The five severities are: Binah, Gevurah, Hod, Yesod (since it inclines toward judgment), and Malchut.",
                "30": "31. The six sefirot of <i>Zeir Anpin </i>are called <i>Vav Kitzvot </i>(The Six Corners), corresponding to the six directions in the world: Chesed - corresponds to south, Gevurah - to the north, Tiferet - to the east, Netzach - to up, Hod - to down, and Yesod - to the west.",
                "31": "32. G-d formed all the limbs and organs of man corresponding to the supernal conducts. Each of man's limbs hints at a divine conduct. Since there are ten general sefirot, so too, in man, there are ten general corresponding parts: The Head - corresponds to the first three sefirot, The Skull and Membrane - to Keter, The Right Hemisphere of the Brain - to Chochmah, The Left Hemisphere of the Brain - to Binah, (The Cerebellum - to Daat) The Right Arm and Hand - to Chesed, The Left Arm and Hand - to Gevurah, The Torso - to Tiferet, The Right Leg and Foot, to Netzach, The Left Leg and Foot, to Hod, The Male Organ (which carries the sign of the Holy Covenant - Brit Kodesh) - To Yesod and the Glans (Ateret Habrit) - to Malchut.",
                "32": "33. Kabbalah sometimes refers to the sefirot by the names of their corresponding limbs in man. For example, Keter is called <i>Gulgalta - </i>Skull; Chochmah and Binah are called <i>Mochin </i>- The Brains; Chesed is called The Right Arm, etc. Obviously, these names are allegorical. It should not, G-d Forbid, enter ones mind that any image or form exists, for this would certainly be an absolute error, constituting a complete denial of Torah. "

Above, the limbs of man and their spiritual counterparts were categorized in a general way. More specifically, the conducts are further subdivided. Every general sefirah of Keter contains ten sefirot, Keter of Keter, Chochmah of Keter, Binah of Keter, etc., until Malchut of Keter. So, also the general sefirah of Chochmah contains ten sefirot. Keter of Chochmah, Chochmah of Chochmah, etc., this principle applies to all the sefirot.)",

These are called the Seven Gates or Orifices. According to the GR\"A, they correspond to the seven sefirot: <br>The Right Eye - to Chesed, <br>The Left Eye - to Netzach, <br>The Right Ear - to Gevurah, <br>The Left Ear - to Hod, <br>The Right Nostril - to Tiferet, <br>The Left Nostril - to Yesod, <br>and The Mouth - to Malchut.",
                "4": "38. Kabbalah sometimes refers to the subdivisions of Keter by the names of their corresponding parts in the head. For example: <i>Peh</i> - Mouth, refers to Malchut of Keter. This explains why Malchut is sometimes called <i>Peh</i> - Mouth, and sometimes <i>Atara</i> - Glans. The term <i>Peh</i> - Mouth, may refer to the particular sefirah of Malchut of Keter, where as <i>Atara</i> - Glans, may refer to the general sefirah of Malchut. This principle applies to all the general and particular sefirot.",
                "5": "39. Each sefirah contains the three general modes of conduct: Pure Kindness, Pure Judgment, and the median conduct of Mercy. For example: the sefirah of Chesed contains Kindness of Chesed, Judgment of Chesed, and Mercy of Chesed. The sefirah of Gevurah contains Kindness of Gevurah, Judgment of Gevurah, and Mercy of Gevurah. This principle applies to all the sefirot. ",
                "6": "40. Each of man's limbs contains three components corresponding to these three general modes of conduct: <br>The Arms - which correspond to Chesed and Gevurah, each contain a hand, forearm, and upper arm. <br>The Torso - which corresponds to Tiferet, contains the chest, heart area and navel area. <br>The Legs - which corresponds to Netzach and Hod, each contain a thigh, calf and foot, etc.",
                "7": " 41. The general modes of conduct as they exist in the sefirot are sometimes allegorically called by the names of their corresponding limbs in man: <br>The Right Hand - corresponds to Kindness of Chesed, <br>The Right Forearm - to Judgment of Chesed, <br>The Right Upper Arm - to Mercy of Chesed, <br>The Left Hand - to Kindness of Gevurah, <br>The Left Forearm - to Judgment of Gevurah, <br>The Left Upper Arm - to Mercy of Gevurah, <br>The Chest - to Kindness of Tiferet, <br>The Navel Area - to Judgment of Tiferet, <br>The Heart - to Mercy of Tiferet, <br>The Right Thigh - to Kindness of Netzach, <br>The Right Calf - to Judgment of Netzach, <br>The Right Foot - to Mercy of Netzach, <br>The Left Thigh - to Kindness of Hod, <br>The Left Calf - to Judgment of Hod, <br>The Left Foot - to Mercy of Hod, etc. ",
                "8": "42. Therefore, when the term <i>Chazeh</i> - Chest, is used in Kabbalistic literature, it refers to Kindness of Tiferet. <i>Taboor</i> - Navel, refers to Judgment of Tiferet, Right Hand to Kindness of Chesed, the Left Thigh to Kindness of Hod, etc... ",
                "9": "43. Although Keter is absolute mercy, it is the root of all subsequent conducts which are preparatory to it, as stated, \"The last deed was in the first thought,\" and therefore, possesses the potential qualities of Kindness, Judgment, and Mercy. In Keter these are called the Three \"Heads\" or \"Beginnings.\" ",
                "10": "44. These three heads constitute the highest of the ten sefirot of Keter. They are called <i>Gulgalta</i> - Skull, <i>Moach</i> - Brain, and <i>Avira</i> - Gaseous Membrane, that is, Keter of Keter, Chochmah of Keter, and the median conduct between them. ",
                "11": "45. They are also called <i>Ohr Kadmon</i> - The Primal Light, <i>Ohr Tzach</i> - The Brilliant Light, and <i>Ohr Metzuchtzach</i> - The Radiant Light. The Zohar sometimes refers to Keter of Keter as <i>Atika Kadisha</i> - The Transcendent Holy One, and to Chochmah of Keter as <i>Chochmah Stima'ah</i> - The Hidden Chochmah, <i>Mocha Stima'ah</i> - The Hidden Brain, or <i>Botzinah D'Kardenuta</i> - The Black Flame. Because Kindness and Judgment are the more essential conducts (Mercy, being conditioning of the two) sometimes only they are enumerated. Furthermore, sometimes only one head is enumerated, since Judgment too, is ultimately for good. ",

The three elements Air, Water, and Fire, correspond to Mercy, Kindness, and Judgment, which are signified by the letters Alef, Mem, and Shin. <br>Alef - corresponds to Keter (or Daat), Mercy and Air, <br>Mem - to Chochmah, Kindness and Water, <br>and, Shin - to Binah, Judgment and Fire. <br>Since Alef, Mem, and Shin are the source of all subsequent conducts, they are called \"The Three Mothers.\" ",

                "16": "50. Accordingly, a conduct which influences the entire Creation, is considered to consist of six hundred thirteen (613) components. However, one which influences a portion of creation consists of the number of corresponding parts in that portion. ",

Man too, was created with the number of his organs and sinews corresponding to the multiplicity of worlds, each organ corresponding to one world. Similarly, the soul of man has faculties corresponding to the organs of the body within which it resides. Because of this correlation of man, his soul, and the worlds, the sefirot are allegorically called \"Man.\" ",

When a person fulfills a Mitzva, he increases sanctity in those organs of his body which correspond to that Mitzva, which in turn causes a degree of perfection in the corresponding parts of his soul, and creation. When performed by an individual only that specific portion of Creation wherein his soul is rooted is affected. However, when performed communally, the Mitzvah affects the entire corresponding part of creation. Accordingly, when man takes the initiative in performing a Mitzvah, G-d responds in kind by bestowing blessings through the conduct which corresponds to that Mitzvah. Conversely, the transgression of a Mitzvah causes a blemish in all its corresponding parts. ",

Tiferet and Yesod, which are in the middle column, begin with Vav, representing mercy. Since Chesed is a higher level of kindness than Netzach, the Vav representing mercy, precedes the Hey, which represents judgment. Netzach, being a lower level is the reverse. Since Gevurah is more severe in judgment than Hod, the Vav, representing mercy, precedes the Yod which represents Kindness. Hod, being less severe is the reverse. Since Tiferet inclines toward kindness, the Yod precedes the Hey. The reverse is true of Yesod.",

Keter gives rise to Chochmah, which gives rise to Binah etc., until Malchut, the one conduct necessitating the next. Through the contemplation of this process one can attain a deeper understanding of G-d's conduct toward the world. For example, though Gevurah is the conduct of judgment and punishment, we know that it arises from Chesed. It therefore is ultimately an act of kindness rather than a desire for vengeance on the part of G-d. Its true purpose is to deter Mankind from sin, as Scripture states, \"G-d does it that people may fear Him\" and \"That those who remain will hear of it and fear.\" Furthermore, the individual experiencing the affliction also benefits, as stated, \"Happy is the man afflicted of G-d.\" Also, \"For G-d rebukes those He loves\". and \"As a man chastises his son\" etc. But since the world cannot withstand absolute judgment, the intermediate conduct of mercy (Tiferet) arises.

Another aspect of the Sefirot is that of \"Enclothing\" (התלבשות) whereby one conduct is concealed in and acts through a second conduct, which is the external expression of the inner, motivating one. The revealed conduct is considered to be the garment of the conduct concealed within it. Scripture thus states, \"Good is a revealed rebuke coming from a hidden love\", for example, a father who punishes or disciplines his child does so out of great love of the child and for his ultimate betterment, by correcting the negative characteristics he sees in him. If he did not care for the child, he would not be moved to discipline him, but to the casual observer it might seem a cruelty. The love and kindness of the father is enclothed, so to speak, within the external expression of punishment and discipline.<br> 112B. Sometimes in G-d's relationship to Israel, the conduct of kindness is enclothed in that of judgment, for their ultimate good, as Scripture states, \"As a man chastens his son, so does the L-rd your G-d chasten you\". So too, concerning the suffering of the righteous, the sages stated, \"Happy are the righteous who G-d did not countenance in this world\".

It, therefore, is described as encompassing the vessel from a distance and is called, \"Direct encompassing light\" (אור מקיף הישר)<br>The second is that light which is grasped and contained within the vessel. It is called, \"Inner Light\" (אור פנימי).<br>The final light is called, \"Rebounding encompassing light\", (אור מקיף החוזר) in that it enters the vessel but cannot be contained within it, due to the limitations of the vessel. This light therefore rebounds and encompasses the vessel closely.",

Because discernments begin to arise in Binah, its light may be enclothed within the seven lower Sefirot as an inner light (Ohr Pnimi – אור פנימי). Nonetheless, due to the limitations of the recieving vessels, (rather than any limitation in Binah itself), only a fraction of its light is enclothed within them. Since Chochmah is not as absolute a kindness and mercy as Keter, its light may penetrate their vessels momentarily, but rebounds instantly due to their inability to grasp it. It therefore represents the Encompassing Rebounding light (Ohr Makif Hachozer – (אור מקיף החוזר. Keter is absolute and unqualified Kindness and Mercy and therefore it represents the Direct encompassing light (Ohr Makif Hayashar – אור מקיף הישר). It cannot be grasped at all within the seven lower Sefirot and as such, is beyond comprehension and exceedingly hidden.",

The primary and fixed nature of the world is that of Judgment since it was originally created through this attribute. Mercy, however, is added to the world to soften its natural harshness in accordance to the degree of Mans righteousness. Conversely, to the degree of his transgressions, it is withdrawn, resulting in a regression to its primary nature. <br>[A.

This stage of creation is referred to as the World of <i>Nekudim</i>-Points or <i>Tohu</i>-Chaos, during which the light and revelation intended for the ultimate good was withdrawn. This is alluded to in the verse \"And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom before there reigned any king of the children of Israel.\" <i>Edom</i>-(red), indicates Judgment alluding to the named of Ban-52, the World of <i>Tohu-</i>Chaos.

This was not the case with Hadar - Malchut, for at that stage the attributes of Mercy, alluded to by the name of 45 was introduced in order to bring about the eventual <i>Tikkun </i>- Repair. What is meant here by death is not a total cessation but rather a descent to a lesser state of being as explained in the Zohar, Idra Raba \"They were nullified and withdrew from that state of being, not that they were totally nullified but rather, whenever there is a descent from a higher to a lower level, it is  allegorically considered a death.\" This concept is also explained in Zohar on the verse \"And the king of Egypt died.\" Such is also the case whenever a person falls from his level of spiritual awareness. This concept of death applies when an inner aspect is withdrawn from an external one, the inner aspect symbolizing the soul and the external, the body. Therefore when a conduct descends to a lower level within which the higher aspect is no longer enclothed, it is considered similar to death.<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The intellectual Sefirot of Tohu were not shattered.

This connection between the Embryonic stage and G-d's conduct is hinted at in the scriptural verse, \"Just as you know not what is the way of the wind or how the bones grow in the womb\". The Egyptian bondage as well as our present state of exile constitutes such a period. The state of the Jewish people during the exodus was comparable to infancy marking the birth of the nation.

This is allegorically described as one name being withdrawn and replaced by another. Thus when G-d acts in a limitless fashion he is called Ayn Sof - The Infinite. When it arose in His will to create limited worlds, it is allegorically considered that he withdrew His limitless conduct - Ayn Sof from that \"Place\" wherein those worlds were destined to be, thus giving them the possibility of existence. This is called Tzimtzum Ha'Ayn Sof Boruch Hu - The constriction of the limitless. This withdrawal of the infinite conduct, which is the ultimate goodness, resulted in a condition of severity - Din proportional to the degree of its withdrawal. However the withdrawal was not absolute, but rather a residue - Reshimu of his previous conduct remained. G-d then drew into this residue - Reshimu a limited revelation of His goodness according to the capacity of the worlds to receive.

All these images and forms are not actual, but are merely to enable comprehension, so that man could have some understanding of these supernal conceptual matters, which are beyond his intellectual scope. Therefore permission was given to speak in such a manner though certainly it is not thus, as scripture emphatically states \"neither did you behold any image.\" This principle also applies to the form of the Hebrew letters which also symbolize the supernal conducts. Certainly no letters or vowels actually exist supernally. They are merely symbolic. ",

G-d forbid, as scripture explicitly states \"You did not behold any images\". Accordingly, the RaM\"BaM explains that the prophets recieved divine communication through allegorical vision such as the Almond branch which Jeremiah beheld, that is, when G-d Blessed Be He, desired to communicate Divine concepts to the prophets, He would do so through the prophetic vision, utilizing examples that would enable the mind of the prophet to grasp these concepts. In no way did the object of the vision actually materialize. <br>179b. It was merely a vehicle to convey the idea. (Nonetheless not all allegories mentioned in Kabbalah are prophetic in origin.)",

To illustrate, the example of the concentric circles (Igulim) parallels the spherical nature of the heavens, signifying general providence, whereas the example of the upright sefirot (Yosher), parallels the nature of Man, signifying individual providence. <br>180b. These allegories, therefore, arise from the fact that matters within Man, the Universe, or the Torah result from and thus hint at the divine conducts. The Mitzvot too, correlate with conducts, and as such may be understood through these allegories. Thus it is evident that the allegories were Divinely inspired along with their inner underlying meanings. However, caution must be taken when studying Etz Chaim, since as in all the writings of the ARI\"ZAL, only the Allegory is converged without any explanation of the underlying meaning, as stated in Nefesh HaChaim, \"As is known, all the words of the ARI\"ZAL concerning the esoteric wisdom, are allegory\". ",
                "25": "181. The RaM\"CHaL in Choker U'Mekubal suggests that when studying Kabbalah one should first learn the Allegory alone and only later attempt to fathom its meaning. In Klach Pitchei Chochmah He refers to the allegory as \"The prophetic vision\", and to the meaning as \"The interpretation\", since both were received by Divine inspiration. The \"interpretation\" is found in short in his book Choker Umekubal and in some parts of Klach Pitchei Chochmah. Nonetheless it is incumbent on the reader to discern between those parts that are the \"vision\" and those that are the \"interpretation\". If one wishes to learn the allegory directly from Etz Chaim, it is advisable that he first learn only those sections entitled Mahadura Tinyana (Second Edition) and skip all else to the book. <br>181b. after which he may return and repeat the book in its entirety. Now, Kabbalistic writings pertaining to the three lower worlds, Briyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah, may not be entirely allegorical, for since they are created realms, actual conditions may be ascribed to them.

Accordingly, all the created realms are considered to be within the domain of Malchut.<br>206b. Everything that exists in the World of Briyah has its corresponding conduct in Atzilut. Because the concept of twelve exists in Malchut of Atzilut, it also manifests as twelve components within Briyah.",
                "25": "207. As stated previously, the World of Briyah was created with all its components corresponding to the Divine conducts. As such, Kabbalistic literature allegorically states that the world of Briyah \"evolved\" from the world of Atzilut, in that it follows the pattern of Atzilut. For example, since it was G-d's will to include His kindness in the conduct of the World, He created the Palace of Love - <i>Heichal Ha'Ahava </i>in Briyah, and since it was also His will to include Judgement - <i>Din</i>, He created the Palace of Merit - <i>Heichal Zechut</i>, within which the world is judged. This principle applies to all the components of Briyah.<br> 207b. Thus it can be said that the palace of Love \"evolved\" from the sefirah of Chessed, and the palace of Merit, from that of Gevurah etc. However, obviously there is no developmental progression of \"evolution\" between Atzilut and the created realms whatsoever, but rather, all creation was brought in to being ex nihilo. Any other consideration would be erroneous. ",
                "26": "208. The Human Soul consists of five (5) levels corresponding to the five Partzufim and the letters of G-d's name as follows:<br><br>The thorn of the Yod<br> Yud<br> First Hey<br> Vav<br> Last Hey<br><br> Adam Kadmon<br> Atzilut<br> Briyah<br> Yetzirah <br> Asiyah<br><br>Yechidah<br>Chayah<br>Neshamah<br>Ruach<br>Nefesh<br><br>The GR\"A wrote that the levels of the Nefesh and Ruach are predominant in Man, especially Ruach which is his essential identity. It is the Ruach that receives reward and punishment, is cognigant, possesses faculties and is conscious of the senses. Upon its departure death results. The Neshamah is a higher level which is generally beyond our consciousness. It is the source of Divine guidance and inspiration. In this sense it is sometimes referred to as a person's Mazal or Malach since it influences him from above. Occasionally one may experience an inspirational flash from the Neshamah level which guides him and elevates his awareness. Therefore, the term Ruach refers to Mans essential identity, whereas Neshamah refers to that which guides him from above.<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For this reason the term Neshamah may often include within it, both Chaya and Yechidah.</i>",
                "27": "209. The world of Briyah is on the highest spiritual level of the created realms and is the closest to G-dliness (i.e. Atzilut). It receives Divine influence directly from Atzilut without any intermediary level. In Briyah the spiritual entities themselves may be either of the aspects of Ruach or Nefesh. Those of Ruach are called <i>Ruchin </i>(spirits) and those of Nefesh are called <i>Nehorin </i>(lights). Since the aspect of Neshamah comes to Briyah directly from Atzilut their Neshamah is considered to be actual G-dliness.  ",
                "28": "210. The beings in the world of Yetzirah receive their Neshamah through Briyah. As a result they receive only a minute portion from Atzilut itself. This portion is called <i>Chayah </i>- Living.",
                "29": "211. The beings in the world of Asiyah receive their Neshamah through Yetzirah. Only those individuals who have special merit may receive a minute influence from Briyah. This influence is called \"Chayah\". Those who are even more meritorious may further receive an influence from Atzilut. This influence is called Yechidah (Unique). To summarize: the level of G-dliness in Asiyah is called Yechidah that of Yetzirah is called Chayah, and that of Briyah is called Neshamah, all of which is explained by the GR\"A in Sifra D'Tzniuta.",
                "30": "212. The GR\"A states in his comments on Zohar - Heichalot that in all worlds the G-dly aspect (which is received from above, similar to prophetic inspiration) is called Neshamah. This in no way contradicts his above statement. In Sifra D'Tzniuta he deals with each world specifically, as it relates to other worlds, whereas here he is referring to all the created worlds collectively as they relate to Atzilut. Only that which comes from Atzilut (i.e. Chaya of Yetzirah &amp; Yechidah of Asiyah) is truly considered Neshamah. All other levels of the created worlds (i.e. Neshamah of Yetzirah &amp; Chayah of Asiyah etc.) come from Ruach and Nefesh of Briyah and thus cannot be regarded as Neshamah.",
                "31": "213. The GR\"A wrote, \"You should know with certainty that Moshe Rabbeinu, perceived only on the level of Briyah in the palace of Will, as stated by Rabbi Moshe Cordovero and the Ari\"Zal. The remaining prophets perceived on the level of Yetzirah. Daniel perceived the pinnacle of Asiyah which is the floor of Yetzirah, since he was an intermediate level between the prophets &amp; subsequent generations. Since then, with each generation perception has diminished, until in these latter generations we perceive only on the level of the \"heels\" of Asiah.<br>213b. Since each world contains within itself aspects of all other worlds, it is possible through allegory to comprehend on our level matters concerning Adam Kadmon, Atzilut, Briyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah, though we have no direct perception of them. Even the prophet Ezekiel who received his prophecy outside of the Land of Israel during the end of the first Temple, spoke in riddles, the depth of which we cannot fathom, so too the prophecy of Zechariah was in the form of sealed visions. We will not fully understand the meaning of their words until we are divinely enlightened (in the Messianic era)."

Now, just as G-d, blessed be He, created the worlds of Briyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah as instruments to affect goodness and holiness, so too He created entities which are instrumental in affecting the evil which He deems necessary in the world. [This is in order to bring about the conditions of free choice.] These forces are generally termed <i>Sitra Achera</i>, that is, the \"Other Side\", the side of evil, G-d forbid. Even though G-d's will is good, He created evil as a temporary existence in order to bring about the ultimate good. The very existence of evil therefore is solely to realize this goodness, as stated, \"Everything that G-d does is for His sake\". ",
                "1": "215. The agents of <i>Sitra Achara </i>have three functions. The first is to seduce man to sin through which he becomes impure, as stated in Gemara (Yoma), \"When man acts impurely below, He is made impure from above.\" These forces from which the <i>Yetzer Hara - </i>Evil inclination stems, draw man toward sin by causing it to appear sweet and pleasant, as stated, \"Sweet is stolen water\". The Zohar refers to this as \"The pleasure with impurities\". None the less the purpose in their creation is to merit the righteous. Through conquering the evil inclination, which seems? insurmountable, the righteous are rewarded in direct proportion to their effort, as stated, \"According to the difficulty is the reward\". All this is explained at length in the Zohar through the allegory of the king who sent a harlot to seduce his son. He stipulated to her that if she succeeds all the goodness that would have rightly been given to his son would be hers instead. But, if he shunned her advances the prince would receive great reward and she too would be rewarded since through her great efforts he merited this goodness. Throughout, the fathers' intent was for the good of his son, and even the Harlot, though she appeared in the guise of a temptress, was the kings agent and secretly desired the princes success. ",
                "2": "216. The second function of the <i>Sitra Achara </i>is to accuse and summons a soul to judgment, G-d forbid, as stated in the Zohar, \"G-d made it, that they fear Him - that He created an accuser who demands judgment, and that the concept of punishment exists, so that there will be a fear of G-d in the world. ",
                "3": "217. The third function is to mete out punishment upon the sinners, either in this world or in <i>Gehenom</i>. All this is to fulfill G-d's desire to conduct the world through justice as stated, \"for all His ways are just\". All the above fall into the category of <i>Sitra Achara </i>and are called <i>Kelipot </i>- Husks. Holiness - <i>Kedusha </i>is called <i>Pri </i>- Fruit and they are as husks surrounding the fruit. ",
                "4": "218. There are four general <i>Kelipot </i>which are alluded to in Ezekiels vision, as written, \"And I saw and behold a storm wind coming from the north, a great cloud, and a roaring fire encompassed by a glow\". They are also alluded to in Eliyahu's vision, <i>Ruach </i>- Wind, <i>Ra'ash </i>- Earthquake, <i>Esh </i>- Fire, within which G-d was not revealed plus a <i>Kol Dmama Daka </i>- a still small voice. ",
                "5": "219. Of these four, three are completely evil. The fourth, which is <i>Kelipat Nogah </i>- the glowing husk, may be transformed to goodness. The <i>Brit Milah </i>- Circumcision consists of three steps corresponding to the three impure <i>Kelipot</i>. They are the removal of the foreskin - <i>Arlah</i>, the pulling back of the remaining skin - <i>Priah</i>, and the letting of a drop of blood - <i>Tipat Dam</i>. In addition the verse in Genesis refering to <i>Tohu </i>- formless, <i>Vohu - </i>emptiness, <i>Choshech </i>- darkness, and <i>Ruach Elokim </i>- the spirit of G-d, corresponds to these four Kelipot. ",
                "6": "220. G-d created everything with its counterpart. Therefore just as He created the three holy levels of Briyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah, so too He created the Briyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah of Kelipah as their counterparts. ",
                "7": "221. In respect to the \"created\" realms of holiness only three levels exist. However they have the benefit of G-ds influence and revelation which rests upon them from His Divine conducts, i.e. Atzilut. The <i>Sitra Achara </i>on the other hand does not receive such influence from above. 221b. Rather, an additional world of <i>Sitra Achara </i>called Atzilut of Kelipah was created as a counterpart to Atzilut of Kedusha, so that Sitra Achara &amp; Kedusha would have the same number of corresponding parts. However, unlike Atzilut of Kedusha, which represents G-d's Divine conducts, Atzilut of Kelipah is merely a created world and as such they are not comparable. ",
                "8": "222. Though the order of the levels of Kelipah correspond to those of Kedusha, Atzilut of Kelipah being itself created does not stand above the created realms of Kedush. Rather it is opposite the Holy of Holies of the world of Briyah, since no created thing can rise higher than that level. ",
                "9": "223. Furthermore, the seven palaces of Briyah of Kedusha have their counterparts in Sitra Achara. They are called \"the seven impure palaces\". Their names in rising order are:<br>Bor - the pit <br>Shachat - death <br>Duma - silence <br>Chova - debt <br>Sheol - the grave<br> Tzalmavet - the shadow of death <br>Eretz Tachteet - the netherworld<br> 223b. These in turn correspond to the seven names of the Yetzer Hara as follows:<br> Rah - The evil one <br>Tameh - The impure one<br> Soneh - The enemy <br>Even Michshol - The stumbling block <br>Arel - The uncircumcised one <br>Satan - Satan <br>Tzafoni - The northerner<br> The Zohar explains at length the specific purpose of each of these. Generally the agents of Kelipah have the opposite function to those of Kedusha. In addition Sitra Achara also consists of ten sefirot which are called \"the ten sefirot of Kelipah\" or \"the substitute palaces\". ",
                "10": "224. Because G-d desired to conduct the world with judgment as well as kindness, He created the Sitra Achara. As such, the Sitra Achara is considered to have come out of the attribute of judgment since that is its sole purpose, without which it would not have been created. ",
                "11": "225. As stated above, initially G-d manifested the attribute of total judgment, represented by the name of 52 - Ban. He then joined to it the attribute of mercy represented by the name of 45 - Mah, in order to bring about its rectification. Since Sitra Achara comes about solely from the judgment of Ban - 52, the gradual rectification brought about through Mah - 45 diminishes its function so that ultimately with the final rectification, Sitra Achara will cease to exist. Part will be transformed into holiness and the remainder will be obliterated. ",
                "12": "226. The existence of the Yetzer Hara and the Sitra Achara is only necessary during the six millennia of this world which follow the conduct of the six sefirot - Chessed, Gevurah, Tiferet, Netzach, Hod &amp; Yesod as stated in Talmud, \"You have given us the Yetzer Hara for the sole purpose of earning merit.\" However, beginning with the seventh millennium which is the world to come and is a time of reward, (and certainly after the tenth millennium, which is the eternal conduct of Adam Kadmon) its purpose will be abrogated &amp; the Talmud states, \"In the future the Holy One Blessed Be He shall slaughter (abrogate) the Yetzer Hara\".<br> 226b. This is further supported by the scriptural verses, \"I will withdraw the impure spirit from the earth\" and, \"I shall remove the heart of stone from your flesh\". In addition, concerning the world to come scripture states, \"And I shall give you a heart of flesh and I shall instill a new spirit in your midst and cause you to walk in my statutes\", and, \"Hashem shall be King upon the entire earth, on that day, Hashem shall be one and His name one.\" Even in this world the Sitra Achara may be abrogated on a specific spiritual level by the complete rectification of that level. It then only exists on a lesser level. But concerning the world to come it is stated, \"Death shall be swallowed forever\", and the world will be perfected in G-d's Kingdom. This will constitute complete rectification in which \"G-d will be one and His name one\". May it be G-d's will that we merit this speedily in our days through Kindness and Mercy - Amen. "
