Even though G-d opened up a small opening (that enabled them to do so) they widened it with their wisdom in order to do the will of their creator, and understood things that G-d didn't explicitly reveal to them.  This is the meaning of the words \"HITHALCHU\" - they walked from their own power, but I (Jacob am different) because 'G-d is my shepherd until this day' -i.e. that in every detail of every thing that I do, I need G-d to enlighten me as to his will.  Even in this situation where I have seen G-d's will (of my own accord), I still need to see at this time what G-d wants of me.  In this light, Jacob is the greatest of the forefathers, because it is a higher level for G-d to constantly be leading him.  This was the prayer of David of blessed memory, when he prayed: \" G-d is my shepherd I shall not lack\", meaning that I should never lack the protection that G-d has over me, and that he should constantly shepherd me, and I should constantly recognise that G-d is my shepherd.  Because, G-d, in his goodness leads everything.  Even if man turns his head away and doesn't want to expect (something to occur) or to pray, and at a time when a person prays a complete prayer then he is answered, and he will see that G-d is the shepherd.  This is the meaning of the words \" I will not lack\" - that I will not turn my face away from him. "

                    "3": "... The issue of the seven plagues in this sidra. They correspond to the verse \"those six Ad-nai hates, seven are an abomination to God's essence\" (Prov. 6:16) [Add: And you should know that all the punishments that happen in the world, including for the idolaters, as when they make a government fall and put a different one, all come from the bad characteristics mentioned in this verse.] [King] Solomon thought to order the sins, and that's why the verse begins with the least serious and proceeds in order of seriousness. And when the Egyptians were punished for all these sins that were engrossed in their hearts, [the punishment] began from more serious to less. The plague of blood corresponds to \"one who incites brothers to quarrel\", because the essence of distancing from the Holy One of Blessing is anger. Even though appetites might distance one from the Holy One of Blessing, it is possible to find goodness in them. But anger is what most distances [a person] from God. Corresponding to \"a false witness testifying lies\" is the plague of frogs. This is because the Egyptians were testifying lies regarding Israel. The expression yafiach [testifying/blackening] means that all small things are blackened and made larger. Regarding Israel, the rule is that if one saw his/her fellow sin, but there are no other witnesses, it is actually forbidden for him/her to say \"Tuviah sinned in such and such way\" (Pesachim 113b), and the reason is that, if there are no witnesses to the thing, it is clearly the Holy One of Blessing's desire that the sin be not publicized, and that it be hidden in this world, and therefore it is forbidden to publicize it. But the Egyptians publicized everything, an so the plague of frogs came upon them, and they croaked and grunted, and so the Egyptians could not listen to each other's voices. And corresponding to \"feet quick to run to evil\" was the plague of lice. Regarding Israel it is written \"and justice slept there\" (Isaiah 1:21), which means that they would sleep it over even when they knew that their side was in the right, they would not run [to judge] because they wanted to find other merits [to the other side]. The Egyptians did the opposite and ran to oppress Israel, but the Holy One guarded them and they weren't able to accomplish anything with their haste. And it is against this [attitude] that the plague of lice came about, since in this small creature you find haste of movements, and with all this haste it accomplishes little, since it is a little creature. And corresponding to \"a heart that hatches evil plots\" was the plague of wild animals. This was due to their hatching evil plots against Israel, and this is why the plague of wild animals was a mixture of wild animals which was a symbol of the mixture of evil thoughts that was present in their hearts. Regarding this plague is said \"I will set apart the region of Goshen, where My people dwell, so that no wild animals will be found there\" (Exodus 8:18) meaning that the Holy One of Blessing made clear that in Israel no mixture [of evil plots] should be in their thoughts. And corresponding to \"hands that spill innocent blood\" was the plague of pestilence [of livestock]. And corresponding to \"a lying tongue\" was the plague of boils, because they gathered themselves around lying words, therefore they were ashamed as it is written \"the magicians could not stand up to Moshe\" (Exodus 9:11). And corresponding to \"haughty eyes\", which is their self-aggrandizement due to all the good that was showered on them, came the plague of hail. This is due to the fact that the goodness flow in this world is rain, and see how the rain that came in your side is hail, and this is why this plague came through the hands of Moshe our teacher peace be upon him, as it is written \"extend your hand\" (Exodus 9:22), since Moshe otpbu\"h was excellent in this charcater trait, as it is written \"and the man Moses was very humble etc\" (Numbers 12:3)\n"

Superiority, which is the raising of oneself above someone else to whom respect should be shown - it is against this that the plague given was darkness, as it is written \"one who curses his father or mother, his light [will go out when darkness comes.]\" (Proverbs 20:20) Truly, even though a person should only listen to God, and a father and a mother are only a small piece of a person, when one's parents are trying to put their child in the ways of God, one should listen to them very much and submit to them, and one with superiority refuses to submit, and regarding that it says \"will go out\". Self-centeredness is [one who feels] pride regarding oneself above and beyond what is found in oneself - corresponding to this is the plague of the firstborn, because the expression firstborn points to raising oneself beyond who one is.",

The truth of this is that Moshe spoke the Ten Commandments to the Jewish people, and the root of the giving of the Torah was G-d engraving the words of Torah into their hearts, each individually according to his blessed will. And this is the idea of the Blessed Holy One being like a Translator in the giving of the Torah. After Moshe spoke the words of the Torah, G-d followed and engraved the words on their hearts; This is “the voice of the translator” from our Gemara. G-d had the ability to engrave these words of Torah in the hearts of the Jewish people according to His own Power, with a strength far greater than Moshe’s. However it is written that \"there never arose among the Jewish people a prophet like Moshe.\" For G-d did not illuminate a soul among the Jewish people like that of Moshe of blessed memory. And this is the idea that the voice of the translator cannot be louder than the reader, that none (not even G-d) can be on a higher level than Moshe.",
                    "4": "The text does not say “Ani,” for if it had done so, it would have suggested that the Holy One Blessed Be He revealed all of His light to Israel, in its fullness, and that thereafter they would not have been able to go deeper in His words, for He had already revealed everything. Thus the kaf [separating ani from anochi – ed.] teaches that it was not in its fullness, but rather an image, a likeness, of the light that God will reveal in the future. And all that a man will grasp in going deeper in the words of Torah will show that, until this point, he was in darkness. Day and night suggest this reality. The day is when God opens the gates of wisdom to people. The night is so that the person will not think that he has grasped everything in its entirety. For all that he has grasped is like the nighttime, when compared to the daytime that will come afterwards. And so it always is. Thus everything is nighttime in comparison to the light that God will open up in the future. This is what is suggested by the conjunction of the verse “Do not make an idol (pesel).” The Zohar teaches that “this verse is taught on account of the [later verse], ‘Make for yourself (p’sol l’cha) [two tablets],’--therefore, do not make an idol, and do not make yourself a servant of another Torah.” The idea here is that the word pesel means something which is cut, delimited, finished and without anything missing. But this is only found in the Torah of Moses. In human thought, nothing can be finished and made completely whole. As the Midrash (Ruth Rabbah 3:2) tells: Caesar said to Rabbi Joshua ben Hanania, “I am also able to make a Torah like Moses.” And he decreed that no one light a fire for three days. But in those three days he saw smoke coming from a certain house. The Caesar was told that one of his ministers was ill, and he decided to allow [the minister to make the fire in his house]. Of course, in our holy Torah we have this same rule, that saving a life outweighs Shabbat. But the difference is that one who desecrates Shabbat to save a life does not transgress the holy Torah, because the commandment to do so is part of the Torah. Likewise, in every place in which we invoke “When it is time to do for God,” we have a hint of “abrogate your law” (Ps. 119:12). Thus the Torah contains within it all of its own future abrogations, and its light encompasses all contingencies and all circumstances that could possibly come to be. No man has the power to do this. This is how the Zohar interprets “Do not make a pesel” – this refers to the positive commandments. “Or image” – this refers to the negative commandments. For nothing is revealed to any person in its entirety.  "

The reason that the first \"on Shabbat day\" is written with [the cantillation marks] <i>kadma ve'azla</i> and the second with <i>munach revi'i</i> is since the shewbreads teach of the love of Blessed God for the Jews, as it is said in the Gemara (Chagiga 26b) \"Behold how loved you are by the Omnipresent\" [in that God preserved the freshness of the bread all week]. And from this will sprout the greatness of ages for the Jews (?), and because of this blessed God commanded to bring with the bread two lambs. Since Shabbat is the interiority [פנימיות] of the six days of the working week, as it is said in the Gemara (Pesachim 106a) \"From Wednesday until Shabbat is 'before Shabbat'. From Shabbat until Tuesday is 'after Shabbat'.\" And because of this blessed God commanded to bring two lambs; that is, to give thanks over the past and to cry out over the future. And from this bread will come the ages of the Jews (?) on the past, which certainly blessed God will complete for their sakes for the good. And because of this the first \"on Shabbat day\" is written with <i>kadma ve'azla</i> -- because of what has preceded and come [מה שקדם ואזל], a literal translation of '<i>kadma ve'azla</i>' [קדמא ואזלא]) and blessed God has helped it to be for the good. And the second \"on the Shabbat day\" with <i>munach revi'i</i> , because on all of this a person needs to cry out regarding the future, and to leave and settle their mind as much as they are able, so as not to turn from the will of blessed God. And if the person accepts upon themself, regarding the future, that all of their matters are considered in light of their ability, without turning from the will of blessed God -- then, blessed God will help them regarding the past, not to do anything without the will of blessed God.

And the Jubilee corresponds to \"Y/yours is Y/yours\" since the mitzvah of the Jubilee is that a person returns to their holding and to their family, because in truth E-lohim made humans be on the earth, and distributed to each human an inheritance that corresponds to one's soul-root, and set each under their banner, and said to them: you are My servants.

In fact, all of Israel is without number, and what is written \"the number will be\" is said over every single specific soul of Israel, that every single one will be counted, that is, something of consequence in the counting, and important in the eyes of the Holy One of Blessing, as it is written \"Ad-nai will count in the register of peoples [that each was born there.]\" (Psalms 87:6) \"And to Zion it says: every person was born in her\" (Psalms 87:5) - this is that God does providence also with the other peoples, just not specifically on every single soul, but on all as a whole. \"And to Zion it says 'every person was born in her' - this means that the Holy One is interested in every single soul. And this is the explanation for \"and the number will be\" that every single person is needed, since through the community of Israel the greatnesses of the Holy One are made known, and if one is missing then the demeanor is missing. This is similar to when they draw the face of the king in thousands of tablets, and if one is missing - something of the face of the king is missing. And at the moment that one is counted in Israel he is the greatest of all Israel, since all Israel is a piece of the Holy One of Blessing, as it is written \"A piece of Ad-nai is His people\" (Deuteronomy 32:9) and every single one holds within oneself one of the aspects of the Holy One of Blessing, and at the moment s/he is counted then the Holy One was in that aspect that s/he is held by and therefore s/he is the greatest - and through this every single person of Israel is heightened/elevated."

The reason was due to Korach taking a talit that was entirely techelet (blue color) and asked whether it was not required to also have blue tzitzit.  The idea from this is that techelet (blue) teaches us about awe (\"yirah\").  Korach claimed that awe of Hashem would be evident to him and that everything is in the hands of G-d (shamayim) including awe of G-d (whereas the accepted understanding was that everything is in the hands of G-d outside of our choice to have awe of G-d).  Thus, how is it possible for a person to do something against the will of Hashem since all will and action is from Hashem and how can one do something that is not His will.  And on this he claimed that we would not also have to color the tzitzit blue; tziztit is hint to awe.  And in truth, the will of Hashem in this world will exist through the eyes of man.  As is says in the Gemara (Hagiga 13a) that Ezekiel prayed the face of the bull and transformed into the Keruv (face of an angel), because a bull alludes to wisdom that clarifies things a lot and creates deepens everything in the context of G-d. The free will of man is not only the negative shells (negative desires) and is also not only according to his knowledge, because Hashem conceals His ways from man desires the the work of man.  And if everything was revealed before man there would be no work to do.  And this explains Ezekial's prayer that switched to a carob tree.  That the ways of Hashem are concealed and parallel to man that are functions of their free will.  And from this will come to their hearts work for Hashem which is the meaning of the face of the Keruv.   "

As it says (Song of songs, 5:9): \"What is your beloved more than another beloved...my beloved is white and red, etc.\"  Thus the Lord Blessed be He, behaves with the Isrealites unlike how He behaves with the nations, in that there is no evil that reaches the depth of the Isrealite's life.  In areas of lack and death there is no finality for them.  The death of an Isrealite is unlike the death of one from the nations because death of one from the nations is a \"broken tool\" and does not have any further ability to correct (tikkun), but the death of an Isrealite is not just a tool for a broken physical body (lit. dismanted spine).  And thus in the time of the galut (\"exile), the Isrealites boast to the nations that they are not burdened even a little because they understand that everything comes from the hands of the G-d, Blessed be He.  And further in their wisdom and glory, the nations have no national conception and knowledge of G-d as does the Israelites.  And therefore the nations appoint the Israelites for three tasks on which no different in hue creates separation between them, as on this they were commanded to take upon themselves, meaning to the level of Moses, that can be found in every Isrealite.  Because Moses is the root source of wisdom of the Isrealites and to Moses was made clear the reason for using the red heifer; since a heifer is a hint to having clarity in life. And the red color is a metaphor for \"cycles.\"  Cycles refer to \"cycles of redness\" which refer to not being weakened at all from cycles that exist in life.  And the idea that the red heifer must not be blemished refers to the lack of blemish in the wisdom of the Isrealites; there is no lack within it and rather only clear thought (lit. wisdom).   The fact that a yoke was never placed on the red heifer refers to the fact that the Isrealites were never under control of any force other than the Lord Blessed be He who rules over them alone.  As it says (Zecharia 10:6): \"They shall be as though I had not forsaken them.\" And this is made clear through the parable of Joseph and his brothers.  Even though the brothers first experienced pain and then Joseph made known that he was their brother and he made clear that no harm would ever come to them.  Rather they only had pain for only a moment.  The Lord Blessed be He in the future will make clear that any pain is only for a moment and there will be no real pain for the soul's of the Isrealites.  As it says (Kohelet 7:23): \"I will become wise but it was far from me.\" All understanding was clear to [King Solomon], he nevertheless says he will become wise which refers to becoming wise regarding knowing this understanding of the future thus saying \"it was far from me.\"  Of Moses it says  (Midrash Tanchuma 8): \"And to you I will reveal.\" Moses' wisdom was only to know and not to become wiser to His ways.  This was the knowledge that King Solomon also knew but was not in his currently within in conception, therefore he said it was still far from him, meaning it was outside the borders of his mind.  This is why the section on the red heifer is placed before the section of the death of the three shepherds.  Such that the Isrealites should know this and not become distressed.  The heifer purifies sin which hints to the future where everything will return to its perfected state."

Rather, there is a hidden mystery in this matter. For there are ten levels of lust; the first level is one who adorns themselves and explicitly goes out for sinful purposes. This is a person who presents themselves to the Yetzer ha-Ra. But after this, for the remaining nine levels, at each point a person looses some of their free will, and it becomes impossible for them to resist the sin. By the 10th level, where someone has completely distanced themselves from the Yetzer ha-Ra and protected themselves from the sin with all their power, so much so that it would impossible to protect themselves anymore than they already have -- and even then, their desire overpowers them, and they commit the act, at that point they know for certain that their actions are the will of ha-Shem. This was the case with Yehudah and Tamar, for she was ordained to be his life partner.  And it is the same case here, for Zimri was truly protecting himself from all evil desires, yet here arose the thought that she [Kozbi] was his life partner.  And afterwards it was not within his power to refrain from this deed. Yet Pinchas spoke [as if it were] the opposite, that he [Zimri] had the strength to refrain from this.  The Gemara (Sanhedrin 82b) alludes to this: \"six miracles were performed for Pinchas,\" as it brings there, that if Zimri were physically separated [from Kozbi at the time of Pinchas' attack], and if Zimri [defended himself and] killed Pinchas, then he [Zimri] would not be legally liable [for murder].  Because this was truly a case of reasonable doubt, yet Pinchas took upon himself the role of a chief judge, to determine the motivations as they appeared to him [alone], and he [Pinchas, viewed what was happening through the lens of] anger...Pinchas was a descendant [or the spiritual reincarnation] of Yosef, who went through a process of ethical clarification through trails and tribulations about this very matter [adultery / lust].  Therefore, Zimri's deeds seemed particularly evil to Pinchas.  Concerning this, the text says (Hoshea 11:1), \"For Israel is a foolish youth, yet I love him.\" This is truly the case with Pinchas, who abrogated to himself the role of judge over Zimri and ruled him an adulterer, leading him to zealotry and to attack him [Zimri].  Yet the foundational depths of the matter were hidden from Pinchas, namely that she [Kozbi] had been ordained at Zimri's soul mate from the six days of Creation, as is explained in the writings of the Ari\"zal.  Even though Moshe Rabbeinu did not involve himself in this capital judgement, we find Pinchas acted as a foolish youth, because he did not understand the depths of the issue, and only saw what the everyday person would see and no more.  Yet even so, ha-Shem loved him, and gave him approval, because he acted in accordance with his own understanding in what [he thought] was a great deed of zealotry, so [ha-Shem] guided him spiritually. Yet Pinchas spoke [as if it were] the opposite, that he [Zimri] had the strength to refrain from this.  The Gemara (Sanhedrin 82b) alludes to this: \"six miracles were performed for Pinchas,\" as it brings there, that if Zimri were physically separated [from Kozbi at the time of Pinchas' attack], and if Zimri [defended himself and] killed Pinchas, then he [Zimri] would not be legally liable [for murder].  Because this was truly a case of reasonable doubt, yet Pinchas took upon himself the role of a chief judge, to determine the motivations as they appeared to him [alone], and he [Pinchas, viewed what was happening through the lens of] anger....Pinchas was a descendant [or the spiritual reincarnation] of Yosef, who went through a process of ethical clarification through trails and tribulations about this very matter [adultery / lust].  Therefore, Zimri's deeds seemed particularly evil to Pinchas.  Concerning this, the text says (Hoshea 11:1), \"For Israel is a foolish youth, yet I love him.\"  This is truly the case with Pinchas, who abrogated to himself the role of judge over Zimri and ruled him an adulterer, leading him to zealotry and to attack him [Zimri].  Yet the foundational depths of the matter were hidden from Pinchas, namely that she [Kozbi] had been ordained at Zimri's soul mate from the six days of Creation, as is explained in the writings of the Ari\"zal. Even though Moshe Rabbeinu did not involve himself in this capital judgement, we find Pinchas acted as a foolish youth, because he did not understand the depths of the issue, and only saw what the everyday person would see and no more.  Yet even so, ha-Shem loved him, and gave him approval, because he acted in accordance with his own understanding in what [he thought] was a great deed of zealotry, so [ha-Shem] guided him spiritually."

The explanation of this is that Yiftach made complete in his world everything that the Holy One of Blessing wanted from him. And on this Shlomo the King, peace be upon him, was surprised and said \"there are three things which are too wonderful for me, and four I don't know\" (Proverbs 30:18). \"The way of a person in the world\", that is, the preferred way of the Jewish people is to complete the Will of the Holy One of Blessing, 'in the world' even the smallest one of Israel [is capable] - and this is the meaning of \"you are standing\": you are connected to the Holy One of Blessing. \"Your heads\": those are the ones in the higher level, \"up to your water drawer\" that is, the ones in the lower level - all of you are connected to the Holy One of Blessing. \"Wood chopper\": the ones who have a small sense of reverence [to Heaven]; \"water drawer\": [the ones who have] a small sense of love [to Heaven].",

Your heads, that is, your wise ones, they correspond to your babies, since taf (baby) comes from the word tipah (drop) that is, one can only find in them a little awareness, and therefore, if one mistake is induced in a person with little awareness that reaches also to the head [of the people], since even in the baby there is a little awareness that comes from the head. \"Your tribal leaders\", that is, the expansion of the self, since in the root of Yaakov our father, peace be upon him, all Israel is concealed, and they were then one soul, then when they separated into tribes then they expanded into different souls in different generations, and this corresponds to \"your wives\" since the expansion happen through birth, since when the child is concealed and included in the soul of the parents, there is no expansion possible, only once the child is born then s/he begins to expand. \"Your elders\" those are the ones who acquired wisdom, and this corresponds to \"your ger\" - since as many new understanding of the words of Torah that happen in Israel, as many gerim come and join themselves to the people of Israel, since as they join through words of Torah they will come to greater expansion, and so the holiness of Israel expands even in the sould of the other peoples, and they come into Israel. \"Your officers\" that is, those who have awe, and they correspond to \"your woodcutters\", since \"cutter\" comes from anger, and about this the Holy One of Blessing affirms that in every anger present in Israel there is awe. \"Every person in Israel\" symbolizes the trait of love, and this corresponds to \"your water drawer\", since water is a symbol of desire, as we know from many places, and all desire and love of Israel is towards the Holy One of Blessing."

It's as if David ha-Melech (peace be upon him) is saying before ha-Shem (may ha-Shem be blessed), that even with all the sins that Israel has committed, we aren't separated from ha-Shem.  It's merely like a toddler, who has separated from their mother's breasts, yet even with they turn their face away from their mother, to pick up something or other, they turn their gaze back to their mother, to make sure she's not going anywhere!  Thus it is, on every occasion when Yisrael desires something well, that they direct their gaze to ha-Shem and make sure that ha-Shem has not turned away from them.  We can bring this from the Gemara (Beitza 11a, discussing the case of whether a fledgling dove is permitted if its nest cannot be definitively identified, concluding that)  the mishna therefore teaches us that anywhere that a fledgling hops and turns and sees its nest [or its mother], it will continue to hop. But if it can no longer see its original nest, it will not hop any farther.  And the community of Yisrael is comparable to a dove, as is understood (Shabbat 49a)."

Thus if a person knows on his own that he clean from some particular thing, he does not need to check for that thing, as it said that a person has to know himself. This is the point that the Mishna asks about when it asks why they spoke of the \"two rows in a wine cellar,\" because the wine cellar teaches us about a Talmid Chacham and for what he needs to  "

Why do you give his lineage? ... If he is a scholar and of distinguished ancestry fine. But if he is of distinguished ancestry and is not a scholar, [may fire consume him!]\" They answered him: \"He is a scholar.\" [R' Preida] said to them: \"Let him enter and come before us.\" When R' Ezra entered [R'Preida] saw that his mind was unsettled. [R' Preida] therefore began saying,[NOTE: Translated in accord with the Izhbitzer's explanation below]: \"'I said to God,\" etc., 'My good is in other than you.'\" ",

Also he was asked from heaven what he wants either good for his generation or longevity and he chose good for his generation over longevity. And when they asked him (Megillah 27), \"on account of which meritorious practice have you attained longevity?\", he said, \"I never blessed in the presence of a Kohen,\" and, this event occurred right before his passing. For the time had arrived that God chose Reb Ezra to receive the Nasi role and, the practice would now be through Torah as a main thing and not through maasim tovim. And Hashem brought it about that R' Preida failed now, that he insulted the priest who was [also] a  tenth-generation descendant of Ezra in that he said, \"I didn't bless before a priest\" [but he did]. And when he rose at the door, R' Preida felt that Ezra had complaints. And they judged from the section \"And the people were looking to complain\" since he was then the pillar of the generation and, Ezra had a complaint about him. And the punishment of the murmurers was by fire. Therefore he said \"may fire consume him\", for he saw that his mind was unsettled, i.e. that he perceived that the mind of Reb Ezra was thinking that Reb Preida would be honored in his coming to him. Gemara: R' Preida opened and said: \"My good is in other than you\" ",

Isn't it the case that in truth in the days of Reb Preida Hashem yitbarach chose this greatly that mitzvot AND good deeds were the main thing.
