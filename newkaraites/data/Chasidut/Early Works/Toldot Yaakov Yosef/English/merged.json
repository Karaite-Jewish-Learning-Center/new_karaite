            "2": "--- The explanation of that which my teacher asked about that which the Sages, may their memory be blessed, said (Avot 6:2), \"Each and every day a heavenly echo goes out from Mount Horeb, and announces, etc.\": Either way, it is difficult. If it is impossible for anyone to hear this announcement – if so, why does the echo go out at all? And if it is possible to hear, what is the reason that it is not heard? For if a person were to say that he heard it, he would be condemned as a false prophet! And he explained that 'there is no speech and no words' above; it is only in the realm of thought. If so, the thoughts of repentance that come to a man are from the announcement, etc. And (with relation to this teaching,) the words of the mouth of a sage are a charm. Behold, if one inclines his ear to listen to the call and the announcement, it is possible for anybody to hear it – meaning in his thoughts. Indeed, if one is intelligent enough to understand that this thought is the voice of the announcement and the heavenly echo from God Himself, may He be blessed, by way of His extending Himself throughout the worlds, until it reaches the thought of this man; and he inclines his ear to hear properly 'to listen and to observe' – then God will continue to speak to him, about how he is to behave in the ways of God. As it is written (Psalms 25:8), \"Good and upright is the Lord; therefore He shows sinners the way.\""
