And this good thought G-d will consider as if he actually did so. Thus, it is found that one is not sitting or lying idly rather he is fulfilling a positive Torah commandment. ",
                "1": "During the first verse of reciting the Shema prayer and the first blessing of the Amidah one should think in the same manner. And further imagine if all the nations of the world would afflict you with all severe afflictions and flay his skin from his flesh so that he can deny, heaven forbid, His (G-d's) oneness, he should bear all the suffering and not admit to them such, heaven forbid. And he should picture on his mind and thoughts as if they were doing such to him, and with this one will fulfill his obligation of reciting the Shema and Amidah properly.",
                "2": "Also when eating and cohabiting one should think similarly. When he begins to feel physical pleasure he should imagine in his mind such and immediately say verbally and in his  heart that the pleasure and joy of preforming the Mitzva of \"and I shall be sanctified\" in the manner prescribed above is greater than that physical pleasure which out of suffering of separation it urges. So shall he say, and a prove the matter that the pleasure and happiness of doing the positive commandment of \"And they shall be sanctified\" above, that even if he were to be beaten by murders in the middle of eating and cohabitation and afflict him with harsh suffering, 'I would make myself rejoice regarding the sanctification of G-d's name more than this pleasure. However he should be careful to say this truthfully in his heart so  that the matter would then be ingrained on his heart in essence and substance in total truth, and not make oneself foolish to try to fool the knowledge of the one above, Heaven forbid.

And accustom oneself to say this with the essence and substance of the heart, and with the passing of time one with feel great influence (of the Divine presence) with saying this. ",

One should also accustom oneself to not look out side of his four cubit personal space even when he is at home, and specifically when he his in the (Torah) study hall and/or the room which he studies (Torah). If when he is walking and outside and sees before him a woman, even a woman and her children, he should have before his eyes the name of G-d",
                "5": "If, G-d forbid the evil thought of lust comes to ones mind, he should say several times \"And you shall be guarded from all evil,\" and think then about the exegesis of our sages, of blessed memory that one should not think lustful thoughts in the day and come to night emissions, and not allow, G-d forbid, to keep this bad thought in ones mind  so as not to defile the divine intelligence (within him) , G-d forbid.

",
                "7": "One should accustom himself to not begin to speak with any person except for a great reason which he is forced to do so; and even in forced circumstances he should speak should speak very shortly \"sifted with 13 sieves\"  so that his words do not contain any falsehood- heaven forbid- or any flattery, gossip,slander,embarrassment or exposing of ones actions to others. And he should accustom himself with the rule that our sages of blessed memory said, \"teach your tongue to say 'I do not know' \". When people who are not careful from speaking needlessly come to speak to him- he should remove himself from them with all his strength and with all types of strategies. And when it is not possible to leave them in any manner, never the less he should extremely limit (his speech) to that which he is forced to answer them . "

And on a first glace \"saving, You haven't saved\"(Exodus 5:23) is a double expression, since he said \"evil [it is] for this people\"(Exodus 5:23) - in any case He did not save them. And here is its explanation, that we in this bitter exile, in which in our pain He is pained (see Isaiah 63:9), and the Shechinah is exiled with us (see Eicha Rabbah 1:32 and Megillah 29a) - the only thing we should worry and complain about is the exile of the Shechinah, and not think at all about our sufferings, but only regarding the suffering and exile of the Shechinah. And if our direction and our suffering were only regarding the suffering of the Shechinah and not on our suffering, obviously we would be redeemed immediately, but we are flesh without the ability to tolerate our pain an grief, and so our days lengthen in this bitter exile due to our many sins, because we partner our suffering with the suffering of the Shechinah, and we worry about our suffering. And if there was one tzaddik like this he would be able to save the entire world from this exile. And this is what Moses our master peace be upon him said \"and since I came to speak in Your name\"(Exodus 5:23) - the explanation is that all my speaking was not only for Your great and holy Name, which is in exile, and not only due to our own exile; and the sign and the proof that the truth is with me, that my intent was not only due to Your holy Name is that I see that Pharaoh has done \"evil to this people\"(Exodus 5:23); that this is the sign to the person who wants to rebuke one's fellow or to say holy words: how does one know that one's intention was only for the sake of Heaven without any other thought or position? If one sees that when one speak in front of people who are not sincere and they get angry over those words, it is obvious that the intention of the words was completely only toward Heaven, and with the Help Of The Highest Name one's words will make a mark - and this is what Moses our Master may peace be upon him said: all my words were not for any other intention but Your Name, truly, and this is the proof - evil came to this people. And since my words were only for the holiness of Your Name, it would have been deserving that Israel be redeemed immediately \"and why saved, You haven't saved (Exodus 5:23)\"? And this is what King David peace be upon him said: \"Return to me the happiness of Your salvation\"(Psalms 51:14) - meaning, redeem us and return us speedily to our land, because all my intention is solely for \"the happiness of Your salvation\", that we should be redeemed quickly for Your salvation, to return Your captivity (Lamentations 2:14) which is the Holy Shechina, and not because of us, but only because of You. And the Name will redeem us speedily, and we will be joyful and be happy in His salvation. Amen."

There is to say that the righteous need to serve the Blessed Creator  from the beginning with awe and guard oneself from [being manipulated by] the impulse for evil, and to break every physical appetite, and this is \"their beginning is suffering\" and after one has merited to break every appetite and one's enemy - this is the impulse for evil - he is in peace with himself, the \"their end is harmony\".",

The explanation is that the way of the righteous is that they have (internally) a rebuker that rebukes them on every action they take, it rebukes them on their faces and shows them that even in their good deeds how they are lacking, and how they did not do them appropriately (lit. according to the halakha) so as to do them for the sake of the Creator Praised Be, and this is \"the impulse to do good rules them\". This is not what happens to the evil ones, to whom all is upside down, since all their deeds are good in their eyes, and even the evil deeds they do the impulse to do evil shows them that they did a good thing, and this is \"the impulse to do evil rules them.\" \"Middling people are ruled by both\", as the tanna says \"like us, middling\". That is, a person needs to strengthen oneself with these two ways, to always dispute internally regarding one's deeds, seeing oneself all the time as lacking in one's work (avodah, also worship) to the Holy One, and that one has not fulfilled one's obligation. As a person does one of the mitzvot of God, one needs to understand and comprehend very well that one did not do it with all the requirements regarding clearness (lucidity) and merit as fitting for Hashem The Praised, and then one will see oneself as humble and despised in one's eyes, and yet one should not, God forbid, hold oneself to be evil, because in that case one won't be able to have heart to do a mitzvah or [study] Torah or pray, and what would this be? A kosher and direct happening? [Of course not] One [in that case] despairs and says that one is not capable to do this. We find that a person needs to strengthen these two levels (intenally) together so they will be perfect within oneself, as the rabbis of blessed memory say \"with all your hearts - with your two inclinations\", and this is \"like us, middling\" and \"middlings are ruled by both.\"",

                    "2": "\"You must not bend etc and not recognize a face\" (Deuteronomy 16:20) because it is written \"you shall not have other gods before Me [lit. in front of My face]\" (Exodus 20:3) and one can explain it like this: behold, the Blessed Creator is called \"face of every thing\", since every thing has a piece of divinity that makes it present and gives it vitality, and if, God forbid, a person thinks a extraneous thought, or looks at something evil, then one turns away and distances one's face from it. And the extraneous thoughts  and the evil sightings and evil passing thoughts are called \"other gods\" and this is \"you shall not have other gods etc\" and this is [also] \"you must not recognize faces\" that is to say, that you will not sin and not think outside thoughts, so that you won't distance the face and become estranged from yourself. \"You shall take no bribe because the bribe blinds the eyes of the wise, etc\" (Deuteronomy 16:20), and at a first glance don't our eyes see many and many receivers of bribe, and they are healthy, and strong, and they die closing their eyes? But the issue is that the righteous person who is dedicated to Hashem in truth merits high levels in the eyes of His intellect, that is, the higher Wisdom, and this is \"the eyes of Hashem are on the righteous\" (Psalms 34:16) that the Holy One of Blessing gives merit to the righteous in the eyes of the Higher Intellect, and this is \"you shall not take etc because the bribe blinds the eyes of the wise etc\", meaning that the person will not merit in the eyes of His intellect in the Higher Wisdom, \"and perverts the words of the righteous\" that is, the righteous that speak in their holiness the receiver of bribes perverts them, that is, not just that that person will not merit Higher Wisdom, but also if the righteous want to negate their words and return that person to the good, their words will not help that person, since all their words will appear to that person as perverted."

And there is the righteous person that also during the days of the week serves G!d out of love, and this righteous one is called with the name Shabbat, as we find in the Holy Zohar “a disciple of the sages is called Shabbat”, that is, Shabbat is the aspect of love, and this righteous person is always at this level, therefore s/he is also called Shabbat.",

And it is important to ask why did G!d chose the crows, which are cruel to their young, to bring bread to him? And according to our previous words “and he sat by Nachal” that he was continuing the Flow from the Higher River, and the ways of the crows, which are the husks (kelipot) is to tear at the flows, and this is the hint (remez) that “the crows brought him bread” that is to say that even the husks agreed with him.

And a person needs to conquer the level of purifying their thoughts until they are completely pure, since the central piece are the thoughts, and this is what the Sages of Blessed Memory  explain: “your rounded thighs [are like jewels] (Song of Songs 7:2) - why are the words of Torah compared to thighs? Just as thighs are hidden, so too words of Torah are hidden” (Yalkut Shimoni on Nach 992:29) the explanation is that just as the hidden thigh is a hint to the sin of nocturnal emission, that comes to a man due to extraneous thoughts, G!d forbid, and the thoughts are hidden, to [correct] this one needs a constant/disciplined teshuvah to fix through words of Torah in hiding, that is, one needs to occupy oneself with Torah with a pure heart and for Torah’s sake alone, and it is impossible to cleanse one’s thoughts in one moment, one needs to attain that level every time until from heaven they will help the person.
