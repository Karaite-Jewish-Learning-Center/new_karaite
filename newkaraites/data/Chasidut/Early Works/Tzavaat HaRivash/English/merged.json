Be Honest in your work in order that it should be blessed complete work, and the main thing is not to forget the sayings {of torah}. Important too is to study every day a lesson of Moral Guidance and Inspiration, whether much or whether less. And see to yourself always, and cleave to yourself good traits and straight {honest} habits, that no comfort is in a day without the activity of mitzva, whether light or whether serious. And the sign for this is \"Be careful with a minor or major mitzvah\" {Avot 2:1}. An explanation, caution (zahir) is from the language, \"and the wise shall shine יזהירו\" {root:זהר} {Daniel 12:3}. What I want to say is, the soul will shine and illuminate from either a \"Small\" or \"Large\" mitzvah, because, \"the merciful one seeks the heart.\" (Zohar II:162b; Sanhedrin 106b). ",
            "1": "‎“I place <i>(shiviti)</i> Hashem before me, always” <small>(Tehillim 16:8)</small>. <i>Shiviti</i> is an expression of equating. ‎That is, every matter that arises before a person must be considered as equal. This is true when ‎others praise or denigrate someone, and so too with all other matters. Similarly, regarding food, ‎whether eating delicacies or anything else, all should be equal in one’s eyes, because the evil ‎inclination has been removed from him entirely. Whatever arises, a person must declare, “This too ‎is from Hashem, and if it is proper in His eyes, etc.,” and all of a person’s actions should be for the ‎sake of Heaven, although from the individual’s perspective there is no difference [between good ‎and bad events] at all.  This is a very high level.‎ Every person must serve Hashem with all their strength, for it is all necessity, for Hashem desires ‎that people serve Him in every way. Meaning: there are times when a person engages in ‎conversation and is unable to learn  Torah. At these times, a person must maintain focus on ‎Hashem and perform [Kabbalistic] yichudim. And when a person is going on the way and is unable ‎to pray or learn as usual, and one must find other ways in which to serve Hashem, one must never ‎be distraught about these things. Hashem wishes to be served in many ways, and therefore He ‎grants the opportunity to travel or converse in order to serve Hashem in that way. “Commit your ‎deeds to Hashem, and your thoughts will be established” <small>(Mishlei 16:3)</small>. Everything that occurs, a ‎person should think that it is from Him.‎ It is appropriate for one to ask Hashem to always grant what Hashem knows to be in one’s best ‎interest, and not what a person thinks based on their own mind. It is possible that what is good in ‎one’s eyes could be detrimental. As such one should cast everything, all of one’s matters and ‎needs, upon Hashem.‎"

Thus [when seeing an aspect of] love, remember the love of God; and with [an aspect of] fear remember the fear of God, as this is elaborated in various sources. Even when going to the privy have in mind “I am separating the bad from the good,” with the good remaining for the Divine service. This is the concept of yichudim (unifications). Likewise, when going to sleep think that your mental faculties go to the Holy One, blessed be He, and will be strengthened for the Divine service. "
