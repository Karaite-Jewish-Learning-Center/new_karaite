            "1": "God's glory cries out from all things.",
            "2": "Even the stories of all nations ring with God's glory.  This is the meaning of the verse, \"Let the nations tell of His glory\" (Psalms 96:3).  It is even reflected in their tales.",
            "3": "God's glory always cries out, calling you to come close to Him.  For God, with all His love and mercy, wants you to be close.",
            "4": "Sometimes in the middle of your prayers, you become enflamed and the words flow from your lips with burning devotion.",
            "5": "At this time, God's own light is inside you, beckoning you to draw near.  This arousal is a spark of God's own Essence.",
            "6": "It is written, \"He is your praise, He is your God\" (Deuteronomy 10:21).  God Himself is in your praise and prayer, and at times, you pray right in front of God.",
            "7": "[And sometimes] when God withdraws and is far off, you must still pray to Him.  It is written, \"Throw your burden upon God\" (Psalms 55:23). You must literally throw your prayers towards God from afar.  The Tikkuney Zohar (#21, 61b) states, \"Happy is the man who knows how to throw arrows.\"  These are the prayers that must be thrown towards God."
