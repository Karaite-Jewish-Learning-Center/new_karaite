To serve (G-d) from love is not comparable to serving from fear, as the author of the \"Sefer HaBris\" delved and expounded to explain the root of love and fear very well. \"The words of the mouth of the wise is grace\" (Ecclesiastes 10:12). Praiseworthy is the man who is diligent with his words. To make habit the work which is before me I will come in short, and I will write some notes for myself and for others in my condition, according to that which I learned from the book quoted earlier (\"Sefer HaBris\") and other books which I have seen to be a reminder between my eyes, and may G-d the Almighty assist me in the matter of honoring His name.

            "0": "The love of sons and daughters: The love of sons and daughters is necessitated by nature, for they are the bone from his bone and flesh from his flesh, and even ???. But one must take care that his love does not overturn boundaries, that he does not make his son suffer and longs for him greatly and gives him extra love. Shlomo has already said in his wisdom (Proverbs 13:24) \"One who spares his rod hates his son, but one who loves him rebukes him.\" And the essence of love is love of the soul, and included in this is love of oneself, for ??? gives merit to the father. As it is written (ibid 29:17): \"Punish your son and he will give delicacies to your soul.\" Therefore, a person should be careful to behave with his son with open rebuke and hidden love, according to what he understands in his youth. \"Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a youth, a rod of rebuke will distance him from it\" (ibid 22:15). But the father should take care not to be cruel to his child and not to hit him and give him a bruise out of anger. Rather he should lead him with gentleness and with mercy he should hit his legs, not on a place where he will sustain a wound like between the eyes. And when he is older, \"a rebuke enters deeper into a man of understanding\" (ibid 17:10). And it is known (Moed Katan 17a): that he who hits his adult son transgresses because of the sin of putting a stumbling block before a blind person, etc. This does not refer to an actual adult, rather according to the son's understanding and character traits\" when he is older and does not accept rebuke, \"a soft tongue breaks the bone\" (Proverbs 25:15) and he will not be lenient in his own honor so that his reputation will not be ruined. And he [the father] needs to be even more careful with that which our rabbi cautioned (Shabbat 10b): One should not teach his son when he is among other boys, for \"jealousy is as difficult as the grave\" (Song of Songs 5:6). The principle is: according to the mental ability and character traits of the son is how a father needs to behave with him in a way that he will not sin. If he does sin against him, he should be quick to forgive him so his son will not be punished on account of him, and he should not be exacting with them, and sometimes he should make himself like a deaf person who does not hear and as if he does not see, and sometimes he should submit his will to their will. And this is a major principle for one who wants to  bring merit to his soul and the souls of his sons after him."

            "0": "Healing - Our sages of blessed memory said on the verse \"And heal he will be healed\" [shemot 21;19] - from here the Torah gave the permission to doctors to heal. [berakhot 40a] And it is also said [with respect to illnesses] - that they are bad and trustworthy [Deut / devarim 28;59] - that they are \"trustworthy\" as an emissary / delegate [of heaven] [rashi there] for at the time that they are appointed / delegated [to fall upon a person] - it is decreed upon them that they should only leave on a determined day by the appointed doctor using the prescribed medicine. Our sages have also said \"A person should not live in a place where there is no doctor\" [sanhedrin 17b]",
            "1": "\tAnd thus we find that an [interesting] inquiry arises. Since it is Hashem who determines death and life - what what will the doctor add [by aiding to heal the patient]? Is it not so that if it was decreed [in Heaven] that one will die, even if all the doctors in the world arose to heal him, they would not be able to save him from death?And thus [we can better understand] our sages statement \"the error / malpractice of the doctor is the will of the Creator\" and it is not in his power to save. And if it was decreed upon the person that he should live, even without a doctor, the Holy One Blessed Be He, will turn over [worlds] and cure him. For Hashem has many ways and with Him there is much deliverance and He will stretch out his word [other version \"hand\"] and heal him. However, the answer to this inquiry and to many others like it is that there are three different types of decrees - 1) If he is one that holds a special merit and his merit is strong and his fate is salutary - even if he doesn't have a doctor and he does things that will worsen his condition, he will not die and \"live he will live\". 2) And there are those, upon whom death is decreed - that is to say, even if he guarded himself with all protection in the world, his persistence of protecting himself is all in vain, and doctors will be of no help and he will not be saved. 3) However, there are those who, due to their sins, place themselves under the influence of \"nature\": - if they protect themselves and act with the proper cures according to nature - \"live he will live\" - he will surely live.  - and if not they will die and on this type of person it is said \"and there is death without judgment.\"",
            "2": "\tBehold, thus each person needs to seek the proper cure when he needs them. For if he will not do this and will cause \"death without judgment\", he will be held accountable for his life. And he is at fault [his death is worthwhile] for he transgressed on that that is written [in the Torah], \"and you shall protect very well your life.\" [deut / devarim 4;15]  And the person who does not preserve his health, and does not act in the according to nature, to seek the proper medical treatment of his illness, to the best of his ability - will surely be punished since he transgressed that which is written in the Torah. It also comes out that he depended on a miracle and if a miracle was done for him, a part of his merits will be taken away.",
            "3": "One needs to be very careful to guard one's health so that he will not become ill. And if he did become sick, he needs to seek cures and consult expert physicians. And he should not be concerned about his money [he will spend for the cure], for a person should give all his money to save his life. As it says in the Zohar HaKadosh \"that one who is apt to suffer monetary loss, he will fall into house of illness, and will not be cured until the amount that it was decreed for him to lose, is spent.\" That is why it is good advice to spend the money as quickly as possible. And how good is it for a person to increase his giving of charity - for he gains a mitzvah and it is a segulah (an ability) to nullify the decree [of suffering]. Really, before a person should seek cures - he should always believe with complete conviction - that his healing is in the hands of the Holy One Blessed be He - the Merciful and Trustworthy Physician - Healer of Israel, His people. Thus, he should preface [his acts], with prayer before Him. (And I already composed a prayer for an ill person and placed it in my place of prayer)",
            "4": "A person who has a sick person in his household, is obligated not to slumber, and not to remain silent, and not to rest until he seeks all types of doctors and all sorts of remedies according to his means / until he achieves his objective. And if he is a needy person, and he cannot afford [proper diagnosis and treatment], the obligation falls on the citizens of his city and/or on the Bikur Holim Organization (lit - visitation of the ill society - ie, the illness relief fund). - to assign for him doctors and cures - and they should not be concerned about the great expenses, for they should consider how great is the mitzvah. Go and learn till where the obligation to heal applies, for behold they permitted our holy / strict Shabbat to be desecrated and to transgress upon the entire Torah in order to treat a person who was in mortal danger. As our the Talmud says \"It is better for one to desecrate one Shabbat so that one may observe many other Shabbats.\" [shabbat 151a] And how much more so that it is proper to spend all the money in the world in order to save one Jewish soul - for it is as if one saved the entire world. And even if with all this effort the person still passed away, G-d forbid, this should not serve to make them regret and balk (at the money spent). Rather they should rejoice in their hearts knowing they did did what was required of them to do. To Hashem - they are doing the best that they can do - and Hashem will pay them seven times over in their laps with wealth and riches in their home. "
