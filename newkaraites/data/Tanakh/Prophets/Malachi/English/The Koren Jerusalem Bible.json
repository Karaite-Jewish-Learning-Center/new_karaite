Thus says the Lord of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall be called, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom the \n\t\t\t\t\tLord has indignation for ever.",

            "7": "And if you offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if you offer a lame or sick animal, is that not evil? offer it now to thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or will he show you favour? says the Lord of hosts.",
            "8": "And now, I pray you, entreat God that he will be gracious to us: this has been your doing: will he show favour to any of you? says the \n\t\t\t\t\tLord of hosts.",
            "9": "O that there were one among you who would shut the doors that you might not kindle fire on my altar for nought! I have no pleasure in you, says the Lord of hosts, nor will I accept an offering at your hand.",
            "10": "For from the rising of the sun until it goes down, my name is great among the nations; and in every place incense is burnt and sacrifices are offered to my name, and a pure offering: for \n\t\t\t\t\tmy name is great among the nations, says the Lord of hosts.",
            "11": "But you profane it, in that you suppose that the table of the Lord is disgusting, and its fruit contemptible to eat.",
            "12": "And you have said, Behold, what a weariness it is! and you have snuffed at it, says the Lord of hosts; and you have brought that which was torn, and the lame, and the sick; so you have brought an offering: should I accept this at your hand? says the \n\t\t\t\t\tLord.",
            "13": "But cursed be the deceiver, who has in his flock a male, and yet vows, and sacrifices to the Lord what is blemished: for I am a great king, says the Lord of hosts, and \n\t\t\t\t\tmy name is feared among the nations."

            "13": "And you say, Why is this? It is because the Lord has been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt treacherously: yet she is thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant.",
            "14": "And has he not ordained one flesh, so that one should have a spiritual kin? And what does that one flesh seek? A godly seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.",
