            "1": "Hear, O heavens, which trembled when I gave my law to my people, and give ear, O earth, which was agitated on account of my words, for the Lord has spoken. My people, the house of Israel, whom I called sons, I loved them, I made them glorious; but they have rebelled against my Word.",
            "2": "The ox knoweth his purchaser, and the ass his master's crib; but Israel has not learned to know my fear, my people doth not consider to return to my law.",
            "3": "Woe to those who are called a holy people, because they have sinned; a chosen congregation, but they have multiplied sins; they are surnamed a beloved seed, but they have done evil; they are called beloved sons, but they have corrupted their paths; they have forsaken the worship of the Lord; they abhorred the fear of the Holy One of Israel, and because their works are evil they are turned away, and they are turned back.",
            "4": "They do not consider so as to say, Wherefore has He smitten us? They continue in sin;' they do not say, Why is all the head sick, and the whole heart faint?",
            "5": "From the lowest of my people even unto the chief of them, there is not one amongst them who is perfect in my fear: all of them are disobedient and rebellious; they are polluted with sins, they are like an ulcerous wound; they have not forsaken their pride, neither long for repentance; they have also no righteousness to protect them.",
            "6": "Your land is desolate, your cities each burnt with fire; in your presence the nations possess it. On account of their sins it is laid desolate: from you it is transferred, and it belongs to aliens.",
            "7": "The congregation of Zion is left as a booth in a vineyard after they have gathered the grapes; as a lodge for passing the night in, in a garden of cucumbers after they have gleaned it; as a city against which they lay siege.",
            "8": "Except the exceeding goodness of the Lord of hosts had caused to remain unto us in His mercy a deliverance, we had sins, on account of which we certainly had perished as the men of Sodom, and as the inhabitants of Gomorrah we would have been consumed.",
            "9": "Hear ye the word of the Lord, ye rulers, whose works are evil, as of the rulers of Sodom; give ear to the law of our God, O people, whose works are evil like those of the people of Gomorrah.",
            "10": "I'll have no pleasure in the multitude of your holy sacrifices, saith the Lord: I am full with the abundance of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts, and the blood of bullocks, and of lambs, and of he-goats; for in such I have no pleasure.",
            "11": "When ye come to appear before me, who has required this at your hand, and that ye should come? Tread not my courts;",
            "12": "Bring no more the oblation obtained by oppression; sacrifice is an abomination before me; the new moons and Sabbaths, the assembly ye are congregating, your sins shall not be forgiven, nor shall I hear your prayer at the time of your congregating yourselves together.",
            "13": "Your new moons and your appointed feasts my Word hates; they are an abomination before me. I have often forgiven you.",
            "14": "When your priests are spreading out their hands to pray for you, I shall make to ascend the presence of my Shekinah from you; and when you are multiplying prayer, it is not my pleasure to accept your prayer at your hands, they being full of the blood of the innocent.",
            "15": "Return to the law; make you clean from your sins; put away the evil of your doings from before the presence of my Word; cease to do evil;",
            "16": "Learn to do well; seek judgment; judge ye justice for him who is suffering violence; do justice to the orphan; hear ye the cry of the widow.",
            "17": "Then, when ye return to the law, ye shall pray before me, and I will grant your petition, saith the Lord. Though your sins be stained as with dye, they shall be white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be pure as wool.",
            "18": "If ye be willing and obedient to my Word, ye shall eat the good of the land.",
            "19": "But if ye refuse, and will not be obedient to my Word, ye shall be slain with the sword of the enemy; for the Word of the Lord has decreed it thus.",
            "20": "How are the works of the faithful city become like those of an harlot! she was full of those who did judgment, truth was wrought in her; but now they are murderers!",
            "21": "Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water.",
            "22": "Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: all of them love gifts. One saith to the other, Show me kindness in my cause, and I will repay thee in thy cause. The fatherless they judge not, and the cry of the widow does not come before them.",
            "23": "Therefore saith the Lord of the world, the Lord of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel, The city of Jerusalem, I will comfort her; but woe to the wicked, when I shall reveal myself, to render just recompense to the enemies of my people, and render vengeance to my enemies.",
            "24": "And I will turn the blow of my might upon thee; and I will scour away all the wicked, as he that is scouring with soap, and take away all thy sin.",
            "25": "And I will appoint in thee judges of truth, upright ones, as at the first, and thy counsellors, as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called the holy city, the faithful city.",
            "26": "As for Zion, when justice shall be practised in her, she shall be redeemed; and those that do the law shall return to her in righteousness.",
            "27": "The rebels and the sinners shall be broken together; and those that forsake the law of the Lord shall be destroyed.",
            "28": "For ye shall be confounded of the oaks of idolatry which ye have desired; and ye shall be ashamed of the gardens of idolatry in which ye were seeking help.",
            "29": "For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a watered garden that hath no water.",
            "30": "The strength of the wicked shall be as tow of flax, and the work of their hand as a spark of fire, when one approaches to the side of the other, both are burning together: thus the wicked shall be consumed, they and their evil works, and none shall have pity upon them."
