Even [with a] pikadon (deposit) - it is [called that] because its guarding and supervision is upon [the holder]. And when [God] commanded to count the people of Israel, He said, \"tifkod them,\" in order to hint not to [actually] count them, but rather that they should give a ransom for their lives, a half shekel - and through them, He would oversee and remember the multitude of the people. And it states with David (II Samuel 24:9), \"the number of the record of the people,\" as he knew their number by recording the ransom (the coins). For it appears distant to me that David would not be careful about what Scripture stated (Exodus 30:12), \"so there shall not be a plague in recording them.\" And [even] if David may have erred, why would Joav not make [the count according to] shekels? And since the matter was disgusting to Joav - as he said to him (I Chronicles 21:3), \"my lord king, are they not all subjects of my lord; why should my lord require this; why should it be a cause of guilt for Israel” - why did Joab not count them with shekels, so that he not sin? But in my opinion, the [divine] anger against [David] was because he counted them unnecessarily. For he was not going to war and he was not doing anything with them at that time. Rather his whole intention was to gladden his heart, [to ascertain] that he ruled over many people. And that is [the meaning] of Joab's statement (II Samuel 24:3), \"May the Lord your God increase the number of the people a hundredfold, while your own eyes see it; but why should my lord king want this?\"..."

The verse mentioned Ephraim before Menashe and juxtaposed Yoseif to Ephraim, and the same further on regarding the banners, because Ephraim was the one who carried the banner and he was the firstborn; his brother came second to him, as Yaakov’s blessing. Furthermore, Ephraim’s descendants were more numerous than those of Menashe. However, in the second counting at the Plains of Moav, Menashe was mentioned first because at that time Menashe’s descendants were more numerous and they took their inheritance first. Similarly, when it mentions the Land of Israel’s leaders it mentions him first and connects Yoseif to him. However, regarding the spies Ephraim is mentioned first although it juxtaposes Yoseif to Menashe (13:11), “For the tribe of Yoseif, for the tribe of Menashe.” This can be explained in the way of Aggadata, since Yoseif was the one who brought a bad report about his brothers the Torah connects the slanderers to him. Alternatively, the Torah apportions honor to both of them, and the mention of his leader (Yehoshua) was sufficient honor for Ephraim."

The tribe of Levi was not like all the other tribes, because from the age of one month and over, there were only twenty-two thousand, and from the age of thirty they were eight thousand. Therefore, Levites from the age of twenty and above were not even equal to half of the least numerous tribe. And as of yet, they did not carry the Aron, whose holiness would reduce their number. This, then, raises a strong difficulty: How is that His servants and pious ones were not blessed by Hashem as were the rest of the nation? I think that this lends support to the statement of our Rabbis that the tribe of Levi was not enslaved in the crushing Egyptian servitude. This is in contrast to the Israelites, whose lives were embittered by the Egyptians with hard labor so as to reduce their numbers, and in return, the Holy One increased their population, in defiance of the Egyptian decree, as it says, “But the more [the Egyptians] oppressed him, the more [the B’nei Yisrael] increased and spread.” Furthermore, it is stated concerning the verse, “If it is a boy, kill him” — “and the people increased and were very mighty.” This is because Hashem said, “Let us see whose words shall stand, Mine or theirs.” The tribe of Levi, however, multiplied in the normal way and did not increase as much as the other tribes. Perhaps this was due to the elder’s [Yaakov’s] anger at them. Shimon, who was at this point a large population, decreased at the time of entry to Eretz Yisroel to 22,000, and Levi, the tribe of His pious ones, did not decrease in the plague."

They will belong to the <i>kohein</i> he chooses, as his property. Accordingly, second tithes, fourth year fruit and tithes from livestock, which are called “holy to Hashem,” belong to the owner as his own property. However, when the Torah commands in Parshas Korach to give sacred objects to the <i>kohein</i>, they belong entirely to the <i>kohein</i> to whom the owner decides to give, and no other <i>kohanim</i> may take them away from him.

This blessing was mentioned next to the assembly of the <i>Mikdash</i>, “for there Hashem commanded the blessing, life forever” (Tehillim 133:3). Furthermore, our Sages said in the <i>Mishnah</i> (Sotah 7:6) that the <i>kohanim</i> would pronounce the name of Hashem as it is written (the Ineffable Name of Hashem) and in the <i>medina</i> (outside the <i>Mikdash</i>) as the appellation (Hashem). Also, in the <i>Mikdash</i> they would say the <i>kohein’s</i> blessing as one blessing (because the people did not answer Amen between verses) and in the <i>medina</i> — three blessings (they answered Amen).

This hints that future generations must make the Menorah beaten, and that without the quality of being beaten the Menorah is not valid. Therefore, the Torah mentioned first that it should be beaten [and then that it should be of gold]. It did not mention that it should be made with branches [because it is obvious that without branches it is invalid, since without branches it would not be a menorah]. Nor does it mention knobs and cups engraved in almond shaped patterns [because if they are not present the Menorah is valid]. It mentions gold because there is a mitzvah for future generations to make the Menorah of gold, to elevate the House of Hashem. The verse then repeats: “It is beaten out of a solid block,” to teach that only the law of being beaten out of a solid block [if it is made of gold] prevents fulfillment of the obligation, but not the law of being made of gold. So much the more so — a lack of the other adornments does not make it invalid. This was taught by our Sages in Sifrei (here) and in Mesaches Menachos (28a). <b>So he made</b>. Moshe, who was mentioned previously, made it. He struggled to learn how to make it and made it by commanding [Betzalel to do the actual work]. The Sifrei (here) says the same as well: This teaches the praise of Moshe — he did as Hashem commanded him. Rashi, however, explains here: “The one who made it [referring to Betzalel].

One might have thought that only the proselytes who went out from Egypt, i.e., the mixed multitude, would be the ones to bring a Pesach-offering, because they were included in the miracle of the Exodus. Proselytes who converted afterwards in the Wilderness or in the Land of Israel, though, would not be obligated to bring a Pesach-offering, for neither they nor their forefathers were taken out of Egypt — “And us He took out of there” (Devarim 6:23). Therefore, it was necessary to specify here that they are obligated to bring the Pesach-offering in future generations, in the Wilderness and in the Land of Israel."

The verse teaches us that even if the Cloud tarried on the <i>Mishkon</i> many days and yet the place of the encampment did not find favor in their eyes, so they wanted very much to leave, nevertheless, they would not transgress on the word of Hashem. And this is the explanation of the continuation: <b>Bnei Yisroel would keep the watch of Hashem and they would not travel</b> — due to their fear of Hashem, and because they wanted to keep His commands, they would not travel. Similarly, if the Cloud rested only a few days, and the nation was still very tired from the efforts of traveling, nevertheless, they would do the will of Hashem and travel after the Cloud. The Torah continues to relate (v. 21) that sometimes they camped only one night and traveled in the morning, although this was a great burden on them. And sometimes the Cloud rested a day and a night, which means they walked the entire night and came to the place of their encampment in the morning, where the Cloud rested for the entire day and the following night, and the next morning it lifted and they traveled. This was an even greater burden than the previous case, because they thought they were going to stay there and they unloaded the wagons and unpacked all their possessions, as people are wont to do when they return from their travels. When the Cloud lifted in the morning they had to repack everything, and had no time to make preparations for the trip. And sometimes the Cloud rested for two days (v. 22) and they had to travel from there at night. It could be that only the occurrences recorded here happened during their travels, and no other occurrence. That is, it happened that the Cloud rested overnight, or one day and one night, or two days, or a month or year. Therefore, the verse specifies these times. However, it did happen that the Cloud rested for many years, as mentioned here (v. 22): “The Cloud prolonged its stay above the <i>Mishkon</i>” — many years. This happened in Kodeish, as it says (Devarim 1:46): “You lived in Kodeish many years”."

Yisro thought he would receive a portion of the spoils — gold and silver, garments, flocks and cattle — but he would not have an inheritance among the Bnei Yisroel. Therefore, Yisro was not interested, and he answered: <b>But rather to my land and to my birthplace will I go</b> — for there I have an estate, property and honor. Moshe replied: <b>Please do not forsake us, for, because you know of our encampment in the desert and you will be our eyes</b> — that is, since you are familiar with the Wilderness you will be our eyes in conquering the lands, and you will show us the way to go. <b>And it will be, that when you go with us, it shall be that the very good which Hashem will bestow on us we will bestow on you</b> — With this Moshe hinted that he would be given an inheritance in the good land, as reward for his efforts and assistance in conquering the Land. In my opinion Chovav agreed to Moshe’s request because of this promise, as I mentioned (Shemos 18:1). And thus we find in the Yerushalmi as well (Bikurim 1,4): “The sons of Chovav, Moshe’s father-in-law, bring [first fruits] and read [the <i>parshah</i>], as it says, ‘Come along with us and we will treat you well’”."

For why would the Torah hide their sin instead of telling us explicitly, like in every other place? The correct explanation seems to me to be that when they distanced themselves from Mount Sinai, which was almost like a permanent encampment, and then, after their first journey, found themselves in the vast terrifying wilderness, they made themselves uncomfortable. They said, \"What will we do, how will we live in this wilderness? What will we eat and drink? How can we handle this oppression? When will we leave [this wilderness]? [Mitonenim, then] is like in the verse \"What should a living man complain (yitonen) of? Each of his own sins\" (Lamentations 3:39), meaning the pain and suffering one brings upon himself. Similarly, \"the child of my pain (oni),\" (Genesis 35:18); also in \"The fisherman will lament (anu) and mourn\" (Isaiah 19:8). Since the text says that the people were in pain and sorrow, it mentions and tells us their sin [explicitly], as they were speaking from the bitterness of their souls like people who are in pain do. And this was wicked in the eyes of God, for they should have followed Him with joy and good spirit from all of the good that God had bestowed upon them. Instead, they were like people being forced, like people in pain, like people who were annoyed at their poor situation. This is also why the Torah tells us a second time (in verse 4) that the Children of Israel returned and cried. Their first sin was that they were annoyed that they lacked enjoyable things in the wilderness. They then repeated this sin instead of receiving message of the fire of God that burned among them [after the first sin]."

                    "0": "'''Send for you men''' — ''According to your own judgment. I do not command you; if you wish, send. – Because Israel came up and said: \"Let us send up men before us,\" as it is stated (Deut. 1:22) \"And you approached me, all of you\" etc. Moses, however, consulted the ''Shekhina.'' He [Hashem] said: I told them [the Land] was good, as it is stated (Ex. 3:17): \"I shall bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to a good land.\" By their life! I shall give them room for error with the matter of the spies, in order that they may not inherit it.'' – The words of Rashi, from an ''aggadah.'' Now we should ask: If so, Moses himself sinned in this matter, as it is stated (Deut. 1:23): \"And I approved of the matter.\" And why did he say to them about the Land: \"Is it good or bad?\" (v. 19), since he has been told beforehand that it is good and wide-stretched? Furthermore, what did the spies do [bad]? For Moses told them (v. 18): \"And look at the Land, how is it, and at the people that dwell upon it: Is it strong or weak? Is it few-numbered or many-numbered?\" And he said to them about the cities (v. 19): \"[Do they dwell] outdoors or in fortifications?\"  So, no matter what, they were obliged to  answer him on what he ordered them; what then is their crime and what is their fault when they said to him (v. 28): \"Alas! for the people is fierce, and the cities are fortified [and] big\"? Did he send them in order that they testify to him falsehood?  Do not think that their crime was their saying \"A land that consumes its dwellers\" (v. 32) alone; for even before they would say that, the quarrel of Caleb with them took place. Also, it is stated (Deut. 1:28): \"Our brethren have melted our hearts, saying, 'A people too great and too high for us' \" etc., and here it is stated (below, 14:3): \"...to fall by the sword, our women and little children will be taken captive.\" But even Moses our master said to their descendants similar things, and exaggerated to them about the strength of the people and the fortifications of their cities and the power of the giants, much farther than what the spies told their forefathers, as it is stated (Deut. 9:1-2): \"Listen, O Israel! You are crossing today the Jordan, to enter and inherit nations greater and more powerfull than you, cities great and fortified in the heavens, a nation great and high, decendants of giants, of whom you know and have heard: who can stand up before descendants of a giant?\" Now if the crime of the spies and their sin was in this manner, who would he dissuade their descendants as the spies have dissuaded their forefathers? Furthermore: What was the reason of Moses our master in this mission? If the Land is good and the people weak – then [all is] well; and if it is bad or the people are strong, does he intend turning them back to Egypt? But the resolution of the matter is thus: Israel spoke in the manner of all who enter to wage war in a foreign land, who usually send men before them to study the ways and the entrances to the cities; and when they return, the seekers go at the front of the army to show them the ways, in the manner that it is stated (Jud. 1:24): \"Show us please the entrance to the city,\" and they advise them what city to fight first and from what side it is easier to conquer the land. Thus they have explicitly said (Deut. 1:22): \"And they shall return to us word, the way through which we shall ascend and the cities\" etc.; i.e., the cities which we shall enter first, from where we shall enter the entire land; and this is proper counsel for all conquerors of lands. Furthermore, so too did Moses himself do, as it is stated (below, 21:32): \"And Moses sent to spy out Ya`zer,\"  and similarly by Yehoshua bin-Nun (Josh. 2:1): \"Two men as spies.\" Therefore Moses approved; because Scripture will not rely in any of its deeds upon a miracle, but will command the warriors to arm and guard and conceal themselves, as Scripture appears in the war of the Ay (Ibid., 8:2) which took place according to Hashem's word, and in many places. Then Moses consulted the ''Shekhina'' and Hashem gave him permission and said to him: \"Send for you men and they shall seek the Land of Canaan, and let them study it and tell you, and according to them you shall take counsel about the conquest.\" Now Moses said to them (v. 17): \"Ascend thus through the Negev,\" meaning: Go up this way through the Negev so as to study the people that dwell in the land of the Negev, from the side where israel was, is it strong and they would need for their purpose to guard themselves very much and arm themselves. Similarly the cities, if they are fortified then the [enemy] may entrench themselves therein and they would need to build a rampart and siege-walls, or they may enter from another side. He told them further to study the land itself whether it is good or bad, because if it is bad, they would conquer first some other places, for they were seeking out the Emorite mountain from the side of Hebron; for even Joshua didn't conquer them all. This is the meaning of the verse (19): \"And how is the land that they dwell therein?\" – about the people that dwelled in the Negev. It is also possible that Moses, because he knew that [the Land] was fat and good, as he has been told (Ex. 3:8): \"...to a good and wide-stretched land\" etc., therefore he ordered them to pay attention to learn about that, in order that they may tell the People, who would rejoice and renew their strength to go up there happily. Therefore he told them (v. 20): \"And you shall be strong and take from the fruit of the Land,\" in order that they see in their own eyes the praise of the Land. It is well-known that Egypt is not very far from Hebron, only a seven-day walking distance, and the Land of Canaan reaches on its border near Egypt; it is impossible that those dwelling in Egypt didn't know about the Land of Canaan whether it was good or bad. But the intention of Moses was to study the way in which he should ascend and the cities which he should conquer first, as I have explained. Indeed, Israel in the land of Egypt were slaves [doing] punitive service, neither knowing nor understanding [such matters]; therefore Moses wanted the [spies] to tell them all about the Land, to gladden them with its virtues, for he knew all about them. What appears to me from the language of Scripture is, that Moses did not consult the ''Shekhina.'' Rather, this is the meaning of \"Send for you\": They agreed to send seekers. Now the custom was to send \"two men as spies in secret (saying)\" (Josh. 2:1), and that they should send from their lower ranks. But Hashem who knows future events commanded him to send one man per every tribe of Israel, and that they be the chieftains among them, because Hashem wished all the leaders to be involved equally in the matter, perhaps they shall reckon and return to Hashem; and if not, may the [evil] decree [apply] equally to the entire People. This is the meaning of \"according to the word of God\" (v. 3), that they be – at Hashem's order – chieftains and leaders of the Children of Israel. And what appears to me according to the plain meaning of Scripture is, that Hashem did not mention to Moses their request that they requested to send spies nor the consent of Moses to their request, for if it was thus, Scripture would have recounted here: \"And the Children of Israel approached Moses and said: 'Let us send men before us' etc. And Moses approved,\" and afterwards it would state: \"And God said to Moses, saying: Send for you men as they said unto you, one man\" etc. But the matter was thus: Israel requested the mssion, Moses approved, and then the Word came to Moses like the other Commandments, and He said to him simply: \"Send for you men.\" This is the meaning of the words: \"...and they shall reconnoiter the Land of Canaan that I am giving to the Children of Israel,\" for He is speaking of a new matter which has not been discussed before. And all this transpired so, because Hashem wished for the sake of His justice that the mission be at His commandment, and that all their tribes and leaders be involved, in order that they may be saved. It also appears furthermore that they requested from Moses: \"Let us send men before us and let them unearth the Land for us\" (Deut. 1:22), which is the searching among the roads and about the purpose of conquest, from a similar phrase as \"unearthed food\" (Job 39:29). This is the meaning of \"before us,\" that they shall go after them on their [the spies'] way, similar to the phrase (above, 10:33): \"And the ark of the covenant of God travelled before them.\" But Hashem commanded \"...and they shall seek out the Land of Canaan,\" which is similar to the meaning of \"choice,\" like those who wish to buy something, from the phrase: \"Besides the men who seek out and the merchants\" (2 Chron. 9:14) and so too: \"...to the Land that I have sought out for them\" (Ezek. 20:6), and so too: \"...to seek out a resting place for them\" (above, 10:3). Therefore Moses commanded them to spell out \"whether it is good or bad\" etc., \"is it fat or lean\" etc, and all this to gladden them, for \"it is the choicest of all lands\" (Ezek. 20:6) so that they ascend unto it with great desire. Now the matter was stated here briefly, for so it was. But in the Duplicate Torah [the Hummash of Devarim] Moses mentioned to them all the details from the beginning, to tell them their crime, for they have sinned in their requesting and asking [this] of their own accord. But according to our Rabbis, they sinned by saying: \"Let us send men before us,\" because they saw the salvation of Hashem which he was performing for them regularly, and they ought to go after the cloud to wherever the Spirit will be there to go.  Moses acquiesced to them to satisfy their desire, and \"I approved of the matter\" (Deut. 1:23) would mean that I forbore your evil and instructed to do it. And Hashem commanded him to send one man per the tribe of his ancestors etc., similar to what is stated in Samuel  (1 Sam. 8:7): \"Listen to the People to all that they say to you; for it is not you that they have rejected, but it is Me that they have rejected from reigning over them.\" Now these men were not specified by names according to the Word of Hashem as they were with the Recountings (above, 1:5-15) and the Allotment of the Land (below, 34:19-28); for with the Commandment of God – no mishap may befall its followers, and the keeper of a Commandment shall know no evil outcome; but He, may He be blessed, commanded Moses: \"One man per the tribe of his ancestors you shall send\" etc., and that they be chieftains; and Moses, of his own accord, selected these ones and sent them, and they caused their own souls evil.

The Bnei Yisroel thought that Moshe did this on his own accord, because he wanted to uplift his bother Aharon, the sons of Kehos, his relatives, and all the sons of Levi, his family. The Levites rose up against him because they were slated to be under the authority of Aharon and his sons. Dasan and Aviram rebelled because Moshe took away the rights of the firstborn from their father Reuven and gave them to Yosef. Korach was a firstborn as well.” In this, Rabbi Avraham follows his view that the Torah was written without regard to chronological order. However, I wrote (at the beginning of Parshas Acharei Mos) that in my opinion the entire Torah is written in chronological order, except for the places in which Scripture notes explicitly that it is out of order. In those places it is because of a certain need or suitable reason. Consequentially, the correct explanation here is that this event occurred in the Paran desert, at Kodeish Barnea, after the incident of the spies. The real reason for Korach’s rebellion is as explained in Midrash Rabbah and Tanchuma — Korach was angry about the appointment of Elitzafan to leadership. He was also envious of Aharon, as it says (v. 10), “And yet you ask to be <i>kohanim </i>as well?” Dasan and Aviram did not join with Korach because Moshe took away the right of the firstborn from the tribe of Reuven, for it was their forefather Yaakov who took it away from Reuven and gave it to Yosef. Rather, they stated their complaint (v. 13): “To kill us in the desert” and (v. 14), “Even into a land flowing with milk and honey you have not brought us.” As long as the Bnei Yisroel were in the Sinai desert, no bad event occurred, for even the very severe Sin of the Golden Calf resulted in relatively few deaths. The rest of the people were saved through Moshe’s prayers, which lasted forty days and forty nights (Devorim 9:28). Consequentially, the nation loved Moshe with all their soul, and obeyed him. If someone would have rebelled at that time he would have been stoned by the people. Therefore, Korach bided his time and refrained from reacting to Aharon’s appointment as <i>Kohein Gadol</i>. In the same way, the firstborn refrained from reacting to the elevation of the Levites and all of Moshe’s actions. However, when they arrived in the Paran desert many were burnt in Taveirah (11:1) and died in Kivros Hataavoh (11:33). When they sinned with the spies, Moshe did not succeed in annulling the decree with his prayer, and the leaders of the tribes died in a plague before Hashem. It was decreed upon the entire people to die in the wilderness. As a result, the people were embittered, and they began to feel that all their failures came as a result of Moshe’s leadership. Korach saw his opportunity now to dispute with Moshe, and he reasoned the people would listen to him. Thus, this is the explanation of Dasan and Aviram’s statement: “To kill us in the desert.” They claimed: You have brought us to this place, and you have not fulfilled the promise to bring us to a land flowing with milk and honey. You have not given us any inheritance at all. We will die in this desert and be annihilated here, and even our children will never leave this desert, for just as you have not fulfilled your promise to us, you will never fulfill your promise to our children."

They were silent, indicating that they did not accept this for the following reason: If Aharon would be there with us, then whether the fire would come down for all of us, or whether it would not come down at all, we would all be equal. But if Aharon will not be there with us, and the fire will not come down, then Bnei Yisroel will say that this proves Hashem has not chosen us, whereas He has chosen Aharon, for the fire already came down for Aharon’s offerings on the eighth day (Vayikro 9:24). However, we will still have a complaint against Moshe — he should not have chosen Aharon alone to be <i>kohein</i>, for the fire did not come down in Aharon’s merit, but rather in the merit of the entire Jewish people who made the <i>Mishkon</i>, and it would have come down for any emissary of the congregation, for at that time the firstborn had not yet been replaced. For this reason Korach would not agree to any test without Aharon being there. When Moshe spoke to Korach and his congregation the first time (v. 6-7), Dasan and Aviram were also present. They were included in the command: “Take, for yourselves, fire pans, Korach and his entire congregation.” However, after Moshe sent for them and they refused, Moshe was extremely distressed, and he decided to decree that they should not meet their death as any other man. Then Moshe said to Korach a second time (v. 17): “Each man will take his firepan … two hundred and fifty firepans, and you and Aharon will each take his own firepan.” He thus eliminated Dasan and Aviram, and added Aharon. Korach agreed to this because he thought as a result they would all be equal."

These were general plagues that in the natural sense would kill all those standing there together, unless Hashem made a special miracle to save them [and Hashem wished to minimize the miracle]. Another explanation is that the Holy One said this to honor the righteous ones, for as long as they were among them He would not strike them.

And so [too] with the plagues in Egypt, such that He said (Exodus 7:15), \"and the staff that transformed into a snake, take in your hand\" - and it is to hit with. And sometimes, it will state, \"Extend your hand,\" and it means to say to hit with the staff, since Scripture will be brief about something that is understood.

And there are many claims of the commentators about this sin and Rabbi Avraham (Ibn Ezra) already contradicted many of their words. And the secret that he hinted to is also not correct. Since if Moshe lost his concentration the first time and came back and hit it a second time with a concentration of clinging to all, and [then] the waters came out, behold his sin is in the first time, but it would [still] not be fitting to say (Numbers 20:12), \"Because you did not trust Me to  sanctify Me\" - as there is no lack of trust here at all.

And anything like this in the judgment of this man is a desecration of the name [of God], because they would learn from all of his movements and words, and hope to reach success in this world and in the next world. And how could anger be seen upon him, since it is one of the bad actions, and it only comes from a bad characteristic of the characteristics of the soul? But its stating (Numbers 27:14), \"you rebelled against My mouth,\" is like I will elucidate - that he was not speaking with fools and not with someone who has no virtue - [rather] even the least woman from among their women was like Yechezkel the son of Buzi, as the sages mentioned (Mekhilta, Shira 3). And [so] everything that he would say or do, they would examine; and when they saw that he got angry, they said that he, peace be upon him, has no low quality and if it were not that he knew that God was angry with them because of the request for water and that we angered Him, may He be blessed, Moshe would not have been angry. And we do not find about God, may He be elevated, that He got angry in His speaking to [Moshe] about this matter, but [rather] said [in this verse], \"Take the staff and gather the community - you and Aharon, your brother -  and speak to the boulder in their eyes, and it shall give its water, and bring out for them water from the boulder and give to drink to the community and their beasts.\" And behold, we have solved one of the Torah's questions that many words have been spoken about and has been asked many times - which is his sin? And see what has been said about it and that which we have said about it - us - and the truth will show its path. These are his words, may his memory be blessed. And he added vanities upon vanities, as Scripture states, \"you rebelled against My mouth\" - that they transgressed his words; and [it also] stated, \"you did not trust Me\" - that they did not trust Him. [Hence] the punishment was not because he got angry. And [had it been so], it would be more fitting that the punishment be upon Moshe when he got angry upon the officers of the army for no reason (Numbers 31:14). And the verse does not recount at all that he got angry, since \"Hear now, rebels\" is [just] rebuke, in the way of (Deuteronomy 9:24), \"You have been rebels with God.\" And also [another indication is that] Aharon never got angry [all of] his days, since 'he walked in peace and [tranquility]' from his beginning. And also [we see that Maimonides is wrong] since it is impossible that there was not a great anger from God upon them when they made a quarrel with Moshe. And in all of the trials in the wilderness, their great sin was when they said, \"Why did you take us up from Egypt,\" in that they wanted to be slaves to their haters with crippling work, [rather] than being with God like a son that serves his father. And so the verse states (Numbers 11:20), \"since you have rejected the Lord that is among you, and you cried in front of Him, saying, 'Why is this, that we went out of Egypt.'\" And in the first time they said less than this (Exodus 17:3) - “Why did you bring us up from Egypt, to kill us and our children and livestock with thirst?” - and there was a great fury against them; and [there was also] great blame, as it stated (Exodus 17:7), \"The place was named Massah and Merivah (quarrel), because of the Israelites' quarrel etc.\" And here it is written explicitly (Numbers 20:13), \"Those are the Waters of Merivah - that the Israelites quarreled with the Lord.\" And what greater sin is there than this? 'Woe to the one who quarrels with his Creator.' And Moshe said (Deuteronomy 1:37), \"With me too was the Lord incensed because of you, saying.\" If so, they sinned and caused all of this evil - but according to the words of the teacher, they do not have any sin or transgression at all in this whole story. And [about] that which he said, \"We do not find about God, may He be blessed, that He got angry [...], but [rather] said, \"Take the staff, etc.\"; know that when they need a thing for their sustenance - even though they complain and sin against Him - 'and He is merciful, expiates sin and doesn't bring all of His fury,' and doesn't mention it, but [rather] gives them their request. And so [too] with the first [incident with] water, He said calmly, \"Go in front of the people, etc.\" (Exodus 17:5) - even though Massah and Merivah were there, which [was the source of the warning] for [all] the generations (Deuteronomy 6:16). And so [too] with the manna, [He said] (Exodus 16:4), \"Behold, I am going to rain down bread from the heavens,\" in the way of love and affection. Except that at the end of the second statement, He said (Exodus 16:12), \"I have heard their complaints,\" [by which] He made known just their sin. But when they complain for no reason, He pours down the fury of His ire upon them. And it also hints to a great fury and the punishment of a plague, as it is stated (Numbers 20:6), \"and the glory of the Lord appeared upon them,\" which hints to the congregation mentioned, and [His glory involves] the appearance of the Hand of God that exists in plagues, as you will see with the scouts (Numbers 14:10), on the day of Korach (Numbers 16:19), and on the next day (Numbers 17:7). And it is a wonder on [Maimonides], as behold it is an [explicit] verse [that God was angry with them] - \"And they brought fury at the Waters of Merivah and they caused evil to Moshe on their account\" (Psalms 106:12). And Scripture lists this sin with the other great tests that they tested God with in the wilderness. And the closest of the words that have been said about this - and it is good in pushing off the questioner - are the words of Rabbenu Chananel, who wrote that the sin is their saying (Numbers 20:10), \"shall we bring out water from this boulder?\" And it was fitting that they say, \"the Lord will bring out water,\" in the way that they said (Exodus 16:8), \"in the Lord's giving you meat in the evening to eat, etc.\" And so [too] with all the miracles, they made known to them that God will do wondrous things. And [so] perhaps the people thought that Moshe and Aharon brought out water from this boulder with their [own] wisdom. And this is [the meaning of] (Deuteronomy 32:51), \"and you did not sanctify Me.\" And [with] the first story [of water] at the rock, He said (Exodus 17:6), \"Behold, I will stand in front of you there upon the rock at Chorev,\" and the seventy elders saw the pillar of cloud standing upon the rock.\" And the matter was publicized, that it was the act of the great God. But here they did not see a thing and they erred about the statement of Moshe and Aharon. And it is likely that it would say about this, \"and you trespassed against Me\" (Deuteronomy 32:51), since when one derives benefit from that which is consecrated, it is called  trespassing. And so [too], \"you rebelled against My mouth\" (Numbers 27:14), since He commanded them, \"and you shall speak to the boulder in their eyes,\" and the reason [for this] is that I should be sanctified in their eyes; or that you changed My words, [as in] \"And she switched My judgments\" (Ezekiel 5:6), as I did not command you that you should say this. And \"and you did not trust (<i>he'emantem</i>) Me\" goes on [what they did to] the Children of Israel; or it is an expression [denoting] strengthening - you did not strengthen yourselves to sanctify me in their eyes; [as in] (Nehemiah 11:23), \"and it is secure (<i>amana</i>) upon the singers\"; and (Isaiah 22:25), \"the peg stuck in a strong (<i>ne'eman</i>) place.\" And the truth is that the matter is a big secret from among the secrets of the Torah: For at the beginning, He said to him (Exodus 17:6), \"Behold, I will stand in front of you there upon the rock at Chorev and you will hit the rock.\" He is saying that My great name is upon the rock at Chorev, which is the glory of God - a consuming fire on top of the mountain - and because of that, [Moshe] only hit it once and much water came out. But here, He did not explain this to [Moshe] and both [he and Aharon] agreed to hit the boulder twice, and behold, this is a sin. And therefore it stated, \"you did not trust Me,\" to place trust in My name, that the miracle would be done with trust. And it states, \"you rebelled against My mouth,\" because they rebelled against His holy spirit, which is called, \"the mouth of God,\" in every place. And hence He said,  \"you trespassed against Me,\" since trespassing is always falsification. And behold, the sin is mentioned explicitly in Scripture. And so [too] did the Psalmist state (Psalms 114:7-8), \"From in front of the God of Yaakov; Who turns the rock into a pool of water.\" And so [too] can you detect it in the prayer of Moshe, who said (Deuteronomy 3:24), \"Lord, God, You have begun,\" that he supplicated to the glorious name [of God], that it should forgive him. And according to the opinion of our rabbis (Sifrei) who mention [Moshe's] anger, it is likely that he hit the rock and [only] a few drops came out, because of the paucity of his concentration due to his anger. And [Moshe and Aharon] wondered about the thing and both of them aggreed to hit the rock a second time - as I mentioned - and that was the sin for both of them. And according to my opinion, the explanation of \"and you shall speak to (<i>el</i>) the boulder,\" is like \"about (<i>al</i>) the boulder.\" And so [too], \"So did the Lord of Hosts say to (<i>el</i>) the posts, about the sea and about the bases, [...] To Babylonia will they be brought\" (Jeremiah 27:19,22). [This means] that He commanded that they should say in the eyes of all of the community when they were all congregated that God will bring out water from the boulder, and so did He do. And you should not see a problem in \"and you shall speak to the boulder in their eyes,\" since its explanation is like \"in front of them,\" that they should all hear. And so [too], \"And Chananiah said in the eyes of all the people, saying, 'So did the Lord say, \"So will I break Nevuchadnetsar, the king of Babylonia\"'\" (Jeremiah 28:11). And so [too] many [other examples]. Or the explanation of \"in their eyes\" here is that the speech be while they are gathered there and the boulder is in their eyes, as he it states in the action (Numbers 20:10), \"And Moshe and Aharon gathered the congregation in the face of the boulder.\" Since when they were gathered there and saw the boulder face to face, they said, \"shall we bring out water from this boulder,\" as the sages mentioned (Mechilta, Beshalach 6), so that they not say there were springs there. And it could be that it is as if [the words are] jumbled [and it should be understood as if it were written], \"Assemble the community to the boulder and speak in their eyes, and it shall give its waters.\""

Furthermore, the elders of Midian were wise and certainly knew of the discussions that took place between Moshe and Yisro, although the verse does not mention this. Rabbi Avraham (Ibn Ezra) explains differently. He says that the elders of Midian are not mentioned because Balak [king of Moav] is the main subject and sent the messengers. Likewise [Midian is not mentioned in the verse], And the dignitaries of Moav remained, since it was primarily [Balak] the king of Moav who sent them. It is feasible that the elders of Midian — who were perhaps those first emissaries — came to Balak from their land to consult with him regarding the Bnei Yisroel and, all together, they decided to send dignitaries to Bil'am. But then Balak sent his own dignitaries, officers, and wise men who traveled together with the elders of Midian to Midian on the way to Bil'am's city.

Why, then, should he go with them since he will not curse them and they did not need him for any other purpose? This is what Hashem said to him (v. 12), Do not go with them! You shall not curse the people, for they are blessed.” Bil'am certainly informed them of Hashem's response. Afterwards, Balak sent emissaries to him a second time because he did not believe the response. Rather, he honored Bil'am even more with dignitaries who were greater in number and of higher rank, and he promised to increase his honor and reward. Bil'am responded that the matter does not depend on money or on his willingness. Rather, everything is in Hashem's hands. Bil'am then asked Hashem again what He shall command him, which was acceptable of him to do so. For what did Bil'am know of Hashem's intentions? It is always good to seek counsel from Hashem, as He guides [even] sinners along the [proper] path. Hashem could certainly inform him what to respond to the emissaries, or He could tell Bil'am a prediction for the future. And behold, Hashem said to Bil'am, I have already make known to you that you shall not be able to curse the people, for they are blessed. But now that they have returned to you, if the men have come <b>only to call you.</b> In other words, if they desire that you go with them on condition that you do not curse the people, as I informed you from the beginning, arise and go with them.<b> However, whatever I will say to you, you will do</b> — even if I shall command you to bless the people, you will do so with no fear of Balak. This is the meaning of, <b>if the men have come to call you.</b> This was Hashem's intention from the beginning, that Bil'am should go with the emissaries after he informed them that he will not curse the people and that he will conduct himself only as Hashem commands him, for Hashem's desire is that Israel should receive a blessing from the prophet of the Nations. It was incumbent upon Bil'am to relate this to Balak's dignitaries and say to them, Behold, Hashem has permitted me only to answer your call — but on condition that I shall not curse the people, and also on condition that if Hashem shall command me to bless them that I shall do so. If you are not satisfied with this, then leave me. For Balak had said a second time, if you would just please come and curse this people for me” (v. 17). He did not want Bil'am to predict the future or any purpose except to curse the people. Bil'am, due to his great desire to go with them, did not inform them of this; he said nothing to them. Instead, Bil’am arose in the morning, saddled his donkey, and went with the Moavite dignitaries (v. 21). Therefore, Hashem showed anger because he went (v. 22). If Bil'am would have informed them, he would not have gone. Furthermore, Bil'am besmirched the name of Hashem by going with them because, in going with them under the impression that Hashem had given approval, the emissaries thought that Hashem had granted permission to curse the people and that He retracted what He said at first, You shall not curse the people, for they are blessed” (v. 12), as Bil'am had said to them. When the emissaries saw yet again that Bil'am would not curse them, they thought that afterwards Hashem would change His mind again, or that He was teasing them as a person might do, and Heaven forbid to think that Hashem acts in such a way; Hashem is eternally the God of Israel."

Therefore, Hashem prohibited Bnei Yisroel from doing anything bad to them in their land. However, since the Moabites and Ammonites sinned by not offering food and drink to Bnei Yisroel and driving them away, Hashem punished them by driving them away from His people and commanded (Devorim 23:4): “Neither an Ammonite nor a Moabite may enter”, measure for measure."

Rather, he died by his sin alone, without provoking others to sin with him.” However, Rashi did not explain why they needed to say he died because of his own sin. They could have simply said, “Our father died in the Wilderness without leaving any sons.” According to the view of our Sages (Baba Basra 117b) they needed to say he was not part of Korach’s assembly, because Korach’s assembly lost their portion in the Land of Israel, as did the complainers. The daughters knew this because the Beis Din of Moshe spread this information among the people. Rabbi Avraham (Ibn Ezra) explained this way as well, and wrote that the daughters thought that the group that banded together against Hashem would not inherit in the Land. In my view, according to the plain meaning, they said this because they thought Moshe hated Korach’s assembly more than all the other sinners who died in the Wilderness, since they rebelled against him and denounced all his deeds. They thought that maybe Moshe would say about Korach’s assembly, due to his hatred of them: “May he have none who extends kindness, and may no one be gracious to his orphans” (Tehillim 109:12); “May the iniquity against his forefathers be remembered by Adonoy” (ibid. 14). Therefore, the daughters informed him that their father was not a part of that assembly, and hinted that he was not among those who died in the plague; rather, he died in the Wilderness upon his bed.

On a later day, he nullified it and told her that this was the day he heard about it. The Torah teaches two things here: 1) The husband bears the transgression as if he himself made a vow and transgressed it. 2) She is exempt and is not punished even for an unintentional sin. If, however, the woman knew that her husband did not annul on the day he heard about the vow, and she knows the law in this case, she is liable, and her husband did not cause her downfall. He will be punished only as one who could have protested and did not protest. The Torah mentions this in conjunction with a husband, but the same applies to a father.

The Torah speaks of awesome and wondrous miracles: Yisroel was in the Wilderness forty years and found manna every day.

He was concerned that the people who heard about them would not believe them.

Or perhaps they were places where they could plow and harvest, or there were herbs and plants for human consumption, and there were wells for water.
