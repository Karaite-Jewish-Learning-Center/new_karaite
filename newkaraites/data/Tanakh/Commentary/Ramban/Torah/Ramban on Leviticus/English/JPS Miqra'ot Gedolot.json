                    "0": "\"You shall remain at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting day and night for seven days, keeping the Eternal's charge - that you may not die.\" According to the Sifra, the point of this verse is that they should not leave the Tent of Meeting, day or night, during the hours of service - that is, until they had finished all the service required of them at that particular time. This rule that priests should not drop what they are doing and leave is, of course, operative throughout the generations. It is a capital offense."
