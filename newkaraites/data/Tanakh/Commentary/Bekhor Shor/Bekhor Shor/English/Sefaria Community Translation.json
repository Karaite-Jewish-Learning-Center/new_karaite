And since the Holy One, Blessed be He, commanded men and not women, we learn that the place of manhod (\"makom zachrut\") was where God commanded to seal the covenant.

And it is possible to explain, \"<b>this is what God meant in saying</b>\" as if to say, so thinks God: I will be revenged on these, since they are My close ones, and I will be sanctified and glorified in front of all the people, since they will learn from an <i>a fortiori</i> argument about themselves. Meaning, if God is so revenged on God's close ones when they transgress, how much more so should we fear the same. And when Aharon heard that they were the close ones of God, he was silent and was comforted. And our rabbis have explained that they taught halacha in the presence of their rabbi, or they were drunk on wine, \"<b>and that is what God meant in saying</b>\" when it said, \"I will be sanctified in My honour\" (Exodus 29:43)."
