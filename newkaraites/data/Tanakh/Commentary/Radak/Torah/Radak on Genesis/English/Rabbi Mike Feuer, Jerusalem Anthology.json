                "0": "And Malchitzedek king of Shalem – This is Jerusalem, and so it is written, “His Tabernacle was in Shalem…” (Tehillim 76:3) The kings of Jerusalem were called Malchitzedek (lit. my king is righteous) from Adonitzedek (literally my master is righteous) as is written in the book of Yehoshua “Adonitzedek king of Jerusalem…” (Yehoshua 10:1). This is because Jerusalem is a place of righteousness and peace and will not bear injustice, violence and abominable acts for a prolonged period, but rather will vomit out the sinners settled within her. As it says, “And let the land not vomit you out for having defiled it, as it vomited out the nation that preceded you.” (Vayikra 18:28) and it says (when characterizing this people), “…the gods of the nations of the land…” (Devarim 31:16). This sensitivity is because she is comparable to the equalizing line and her atmosphere is finely mixed and so it says, “The fairest of branches, the joy of the entire earth- Mount Zion…” (Tehillim 48:3) and it says in the midrash that Malchitzedek is Shem the son of Noach.
