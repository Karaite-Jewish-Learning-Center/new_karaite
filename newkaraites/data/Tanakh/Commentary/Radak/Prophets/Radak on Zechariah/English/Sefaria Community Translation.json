And the interpretation is that that day will not be neither all like light nor all like darkness, meaning neither comfortable nor troubling, but rather both of them will be in it. And likewise he (Zechariah) says after it (verse 7)\"not day and not night.\"  And Jonathan translated, \"there will not be light, but rather passing light and ice/thickness/congealment\""
