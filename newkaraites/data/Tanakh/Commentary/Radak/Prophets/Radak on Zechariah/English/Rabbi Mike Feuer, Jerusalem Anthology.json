This is to say - all those who wear themselves out fighting against Jerusalem will be beaten by her. This is like a great stone which is a tremendous burden and a heavy load to those who bear it. Furthermore, while they are lifting it off the ground to place it on their shoulders it will gash their hands. Many men test their strength against it and through carrying it gash their hands. So all the nations of the world will gather against Jerusalem, they will all be gathered together in her. The word burden (maamasa) is as in “…and each one loaded (va’yaamos) his donkey…” (Genesis 44:13) Loading something on a donkey relates to a burden. Targum Yonatan translated it into Aramaic as “a heavy stone for all nations, all who rob her will surely be plundered…”"
