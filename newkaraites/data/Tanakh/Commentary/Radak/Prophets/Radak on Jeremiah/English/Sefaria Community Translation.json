                "0": "\"And thus shall you say to them\" (Ashuri: כִּדְנָה֙ תֵּאמְר֣וּן לְה֔וֹם) – This is a letter that God sent Jeremiah for the Babylonian exiled people to answer thus to the Chaldæans when they told them to worship their gods, answer them, \"The gods who did not make heaven and earth will perish from earth and from below these heavens.\" And he wrote the letter for them in the Aramaic language so that they could say it to the Chaldæns in their tongue. And why does it say \"and thus you shall say to them?\" Because it's a warning to Israel. And that's also in Aramaic so as not to split the verse that it's half in Hebrew and half in Aramaic. And it says \"to them\" לְה֔וֹם with a mem ם because it appears twice as a mem - it's found in Ezra 5:3 \"And thus, say to them\" וְכֵן֙ אָמְרִ֣ין לְהֹ֔ם, even though it almost always comes with a nun ן.",
                "1": "These (Ashuri: אֵֽלֶּה). In both the Hebrew and Aramaic languages. This is also found in Ezra - \"these vessels\" (Ashuri: אלה מָֽאנַיָּ֔א - Ezra 5:15) written as אלה, and read as אֵ֚ל – and אל and אלה are one and the same, as in \"these lands\" (Ashuri: הָֽאֲרָצֹ֣ת הָאֵ֔ל - Genesis 26:3). And it says \"these\" because they are visible to humans, although they are high.",
                "2": "\"And earth\" (Ashuri: וְאַרְקָ֖א) meaning, \"earth\" (Ashuri: ארץ). And in the words of the Rabbis of blessed memory (Genesis Rabbah 13:12): Four names earth was called corresponding to its four corners - Eretz אֶרֶץ, Tevel תֵּבֵל, Adama אֲדָמָה, Arqa אַרְקָא. And Targum Jonathan translates the verse thus as it is, and does not elongate it in Aramaic. This is because the whole passage up to \"The LORD of Hosts is His name\" (Ashuri יְהוָ֥ה צְבָא֖וֹת שְׁמֽוֹ׃ – Jeremiah 10:16) is an answer that the children of Israel will say to them – \"For we will not serve these gods who did not make heaven and earth, but rather the God who made earth in His might.\" And the Israelites will understand the Hebrew, and say it to the Chaldæans in Aramaic. But Jeremiah began the words sent to them in Aramaic, and Jonathan explains it in this regard: \"He who made the earth in his might (Jeremiah 10:12)\" = \"And thus also you will say to them: We worship the one who made earth in his might! (Targum Jonathan on Jeremiah 10:12)\" The truth is that Israel did not worship idols when exiled, and when they bowed to the image that Nebuchadnezzar had put up (see Daniel 3), they were forced. But even so, they were liable in the days of Haman, had God not had pity on them, as it is said (Megillah 12a) \"Why was Israel in that generation liable for destruction? Because they had bowed to the image.\""
