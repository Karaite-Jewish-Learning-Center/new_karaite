And it can be explained as follows: <i>\"And it will be for God,\" i.e. sanctified [הקדש], if it is unsuitable for a burnt offering. <b>Or</b> it \"shall be offered by me as a burnt offering,\" if it is suitable for a burnt offering.</i> And similar to this, the <i>vav</i> of \"He who strikes his father or [ו] his mother\" (Exodus 25:15) signifies \"or\". And it is well explained, and so it seems to me from the verse, for it is not death, because the verse would say \"And I will weep for my life\" -- rather, [she will weep] that she has not known a man [because in fact the verse says \"I will weep for my maidenhood\" (Judges 11:37)]. And that which it also says, \"he did to her as he had vowed to do\" (Judges 11:39), and it does not say \"He offered her as a burnt offering.\" This shows us that she was celibate/separated, and this is what he had vowed -- that she should be for God. This seems to me to be according to the plain meaning of the verses, and the words of our rabbis of blessed memory; if they [the words] were accepted into their hands as an acceptance, it is our duty to accept them [?]."

And some say that he chose the word \"שבולת\" (shibboleth) because there was a flowing stream (shibboleth nahar) in the place where the Ephraimites were crossing, who would stutter on the letter שׁ (shin). Maybe the climate of their land was a factor! This is like the people of France, who do not understand how to read שׁ (shin) and read it like a weak תֿ (thaw)."
