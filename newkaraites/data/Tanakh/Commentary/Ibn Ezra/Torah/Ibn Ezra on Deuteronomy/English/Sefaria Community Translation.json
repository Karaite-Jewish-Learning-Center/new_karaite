Only the word \"no\" cannot be abbreviated because it will reverse the meaning. A great Spanish grammarian said [in this vein] that a \"heh\" is missing [here] and it should be \"for is a man like a tree of the field\" [as a rhetorical question.] (Note that a number of English translations actually render the phrase this way --Translator), but I do not find the notion compelling since what reason is there to say \"Do not destroy a fruit tree for it is not like a person to who can run away from you\" and according to my understanding we have no need for all this. [Rather] this is the explanation: \"for you shall eat from it but not cut it down for a man is as a tree of the field\" and similarly \"for he seizes a soul\" i.e. (in the case of seizing tools necessary for living as collateral, which is the verse cited --Translator) he is seizing things which preserve life. \"and do not cut it down\" [in our verse] is parsed along with \"to go before you in a seige,\" that is to say \"do not destroy a fruit tree, which provides life for people; it is only permitted for you to eat from it and not to cut it down to force the city into siege.\" Evidence that this is correct [comes from the phrase] \"thou shalt cut it down and build a siege [tower]\" [regarding non-fruit bearing trees]"
