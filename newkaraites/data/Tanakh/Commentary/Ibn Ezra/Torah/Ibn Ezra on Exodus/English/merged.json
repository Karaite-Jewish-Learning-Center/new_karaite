And this was because Moses could not be delayed in his Divine mission. He saw by his own counsel not to circumcise, since the youngster would be in danger if he was put to travel. And behold, HaShem sent an angel to remind Moses to pause himself and circumcise the child and go on his way on his own. And the youngster would stay with his mother until he healed, and behold the reason of \"he met him\" is that sickness from HaShem came to Moses that he didn't think of it. And this is \"he sought to kill him\" if he didn't circumcise his son. And due to the trembling that seized him he wasn't able to circumcise his son, and Tzipporah circumcised him, because he revealed to her the secret. And do not be surprise to read \"HaShem met him\" because it was an angel/messenger of HaShem.

In Deut 5:24 they say , \"you go closer and hear all that the Lord our God says.\" Similarly, when Moses asks, \"Has any people heard the voice of God speaking out of the fire, as you have, and survived?"

                "2": "<b>Rabbi Yehuda HaLevi, may His memory be an honor, asked me</b> why it mentioned, \"I am the Lord, your God, that took you out of the land of Egypt,\" and it did not state, \"that made the heavens and the earth and I made you.\" And this was my answer to him: Know that the levels of people’s faith, in which they believe in the glorious God in their hearts, is not equal. As the masses believe that which was heard by their ears, that their Master told them this. And above them are those that saw it written in the words of the Torah that God gave to Moshe. And if a heretic comes to challenge that there is no God, they will place their hands on their mouths, as they will not know [what] to answer. And the one whose heart has elevated him to learn the sciences – which are like stairs to rise up upon to the place of his desire – will recognize the work of God in the patterns and the plants and the animals, and in his own human body - that he will know the function of each limb, according to its development, and why it is [made] in such a pattern. And his heart will elevate him afterwards to know the matters of the planets, that they are the works of God in the intermediate world – that he should stand and know the time of when the sun should appear or the moon and how much [of that time] the sun will appear. And he will also know why the moon appears and Who caused it [to do so]. And all of this, he will know with clear proofs that have no doubt. And from [these] ways of God, the enlightened one will know God. And so did Moshe say (Exodus 33:13), “show me Your ways and I will know You.” And behold the glorious God mentioned in the first of the statements (of the Ten Commandments), “I am the Lord, your God” – and this can only be understood by someone who is an outstanding sage. As I have already explained in Parshat Veeleh HaShemot (Ibn Ezra on Exodus 3:15) that this God is alone and He exists without change and there is none besides Him who is eternal and there is none like Him that 'dwells from the beginning always.' And He supports the higher world with His power and the intermediary world with the power of God, and His holy angels that are in the higher world. And this lowly world that we are in, He supports with the power of God and with the power of the two higher worlds. And behold, the statement, “I am the Lord, your God,” suffices for the enlightened one in every nation. As [while] only Israel concedes to the making of the heavens and the earth which today is close to five thousand years ago, the sages of the nations of the world do not deny that God alone made the heavens and the earth; just that they say that God always makes [them] – without a beginning and an end. And behold, God made signs and wonders for Israel in Egypt until He brought them out of there, ‘to be for them a God.’ And so did Moshe say (Deuteronomy 4:34), “Or did God venture to come and take for Himself a nation.” And the explanation is that God did to Israel that which He did not do to all nations, since God created the intermediate world that it govern the lowly world according to the [astrological] system [over] everything – whether it is from the good or the bad, so will it happen, since so did God apportion it to the [constellations]. And behold it was in the system for Israel – according to the stars of their constellation – to still be slaves. And God with His power – because of His love for the forefathers – introduced signs in the lowly world that were not in the power of the intermediate world, and He took Israel out from the control of the constellations, so that they be a people that is an inheritance for Him. And because of this, our ancestors said (Shabbat 156a), “There is no constellation (<i>mazal</i>) for Israel.” And I will also elucidate this in a metaphoric fashion in Parsht Ki Tissa (Ibn Ezra on Exodus 33:21). And behold, because of the signs that God did in Egypt, Moshe said (Deuteronomy 4:35), “You have been shown, to know” – that all saw this: the sages and those that are not sages, the adults and the children. And he also added about the matter of the stand at Mount Sinai, that they heard the voice of God. Hence afterwards, he said (Deuteronomy 4:36), “From the Heavens, He made you hear His voice to instruct you.” And he said at the end [of this], that there is complete knowledge that a person can place into his heart until it is clarified in his heart that God is alone. Therefore, he said (Deuteronomy 4:39), “And you will know today and place it upon your heart.” And David said (II Chronicles 28:9), \"And you Shlomo, my son, know the God of your father and serve him [with a complete heart]\" - and knowledge is in the heart and not with the admission of the mouth. And behold it mentioned for the enlightened one, \"I am the Lord\"; and it added, \"that took you out,\" so that the enlightened and the unenlightened one would [both] understand. And it said, \"your God,\" since you are obligated because He took you out of a house of bondage 'to be a servant to Me, that you should serve Me and that you should be a people for Me, and I will be for you a God.' And Moshe explained this in the section, \"And when your son will ask you\" (Deuteronomy 6:20), since the explanation of the question is, \"Why are we obligated to do the commandments of God more than every man? And is there not one Creator to all of us?\" And behold, he mentioned three answers.The first is that ‘we were slaves to Pharaoh’ and He did us this great good; therefore we are obligated to keep all of what He commanded us, even if we don’t know the explanation of His commandments. And the second is because these commandments are not for His need, but rather ‘to benefit us all of the days and to keep us alive.’ And the third is that we should be righteous [so as] to inherit the world to come. And the men of research have found that all physical things are ten, and these are the main categories and there is none above them. The first one is the essence of everything and it is permanent, and the [other] nine things are all contingent, and they all rely upon the first and accompany it and come from it. For it is like measurement of one in the calculation of ten, since all of the calculation comes from it and every calculation is found in it, as it is the foundation. And behold, this first statement (of the ‘Ten Commandments’) that the glorious God said includes all of the commandments of the heart and the tongue and the deed, as one who does not believe in God in his heart has no commandment upon him.  And a person is obligated to remember Him at every moment to honor Him; since all that he does, he should only do for the sake of His honor. And he [likewise] should only prevent himself from [transgressing] negative commandments for the sake of the honor of God alone. As a man who gives charity to a poor person should not give it for the honor of the sexton and not in order that people will praise him – as then, the level of man will be higher in his eyes than the level of the honor of God, who gave him assets – and he should prefer to [use] his money to give what he can to receive reward from God. And so [too], one who does a sin in secret so that it will not be made known to the king or that people [not] see him and he become light in their eyes. And someone who thinks this is crazy, since so is it written (Psalms 94:9), “if he creates the eye, does he not observe.” And behold, God sees in secret places that which people are not able to see in the open, since God knows his thoughts and his secret. And behold, he was afraid of the king that will die tomorrow, that he should not punish him, and was not afraid of the true King, in whose hand is his soul - in this world and in the world to come. And Rav Saadia Gaon authored “The Commandments (<i>Azharot</i>)” and categorized all of the commandments in these ten statements (‘Ten Commandments’) and found the glorious Name of God in the first five statements. And I have already explained that the first statement is the foundation, and all of the structures of the commandments [lay] upon it. And after it is written, “There shall not be.” And the sin of one who does not believe in the great God is greater than the sin of one who worships idolatry. As there are many that believe in God and they [nonetheless] sacrifice and burn incense to idolatry, like the ones that burn incense to the ‘queen of the Heavens’; as they think that it will cause good to be done to them, like they said (Jeremiah 44:18), “And since we have stopped burning incense to the queen of the Heavens, we have been lacking everything”; and it is written (II Kings 17:33), “The Lord they feared, but their gods they would worship; and so [too] Na’aman (II Kings 5:18), “in my bowing down in Beit Rimon.”And behold, these admitted [the existence of] God, however they combined another with Him. Therefore the Name of the glorious God is written in this statement. And in the third statement, It is also written, as the sin of swearing falsely is less than idolatry. He just disgraces the Name of God openly – perhaps he did this because of anger or a need, as in his heart, he believed in God and he does not combine another with Him. And in the fourth statement, the Name of God is written, as He rested on the seventh day. And behold, one who does work on Shabbat is denying the story of Creation. And this sin is less than the one who takes up His name in vain. And in the fifth statement, the Name of God is written, since parents partner with Him in [a person’s] creation. And if he does not honor them, it is as if he does not honor God. And the remaining five statements correspond to man – the first is the most difficult, as it is to separate the soul from on top of the body. And that which is after it is not in the body, and that which is after that – not to steal – is with money; and afterwards, it is with the tongue; and afterwards coveting is in the heart. "

However, this reasoning is incorrect. In actual fact, the previous verse (Exodus 20:9) says: “[Any person] who curses his father or his mother shall be put to death; he has insulted his father and his mother—his bloodguilt is upon him.” The reason for this [harsh punishment] is that he has committed a grave sin by cursing his parents, who were the ones to bring him into this world. Similarly for “committing adultery with a fellow man’s wife” – [it is repeated] to emphasise that he has committed a serious abomination by committing adultery with another man’s wife, whereas he is obliged to love [and therefore give respect to] his fellow man as he would to himself. And the word <i>adultery</i> is talking [more broadly] about <i>immorality</i> as in \"[The land was defiled by her casual immorality, as] she committed adultery with stone and with wood.\" (Jeremiah 3:9) and it is inappropriate to publicize this abomination. R. Saadia Gaon said that immorality exists on many levels: the lowest level is sleeping with a virgin or a widow (outside of marriage - see Deuteronomy 23); the level above that is a man's cohabitation with his wife during her menstruation, since she will be permitted to him after several days (Lev. 18:19); above that is a married woman as it is possible that her husband will die and she will [consequently] be permitted to him (Lev. 18:20); above that is an idolatress who does not follow the Torah of the Jews if he has not yet been with her, as it is possible that she will convert and he can then marry her as a [seemly] wife - except that if he has already had carnal relations with her then he has actually served idols (see Lev. 18:21); above that is homosexual acts which have no permitted circumstances (Lev. 18:22); above that is bestiality, i.e. a man sleeping with an animal (Lev. 18:23). [R. Saadia] Gaon knew how to rank [these different levels of immorality]. In Leviticus 18 all of these types of immorality have [the punishment of] karet (see Lev. 18:29). [R.

I will give you a parable [to explain this]. You should know that a villager who thinks correctly and sees that the king's daughter is beautiful will not covet her in his heart, that he should sleep with her; as he knows that this is impossible. And this villager will not think like one of the lunatics that desires that he should have wings to fly in the sky, when it is not possible. [This is like] that which a man does not desire to sleep with his mother, even though she is beautiful, as they have accustomed him from his youth to know that it is forbidden to him. So must every enlightened person know that a beautiful woman or money is not attained by a person because of his wisdom or knowledge; rather it is from that which God apportioned to him. And Kohelet said, \"(to that) [and to the one that did not toil in it], will he give it as his portion\" (Ecclesiastes 2:21). And the sages said (Moed Katan 28a), \"Children, life and sustenance - [this] matter does not depend on merit, but rather on the constellation.\" And because of this, the enlightened one will not desire and not covet. And once he knows that God forbade him the wife of his friend, it is more removed in his eyes than the daughter of the king is in the eyes of the villager. Therefore, he will 'rejoice in his portion' and he won't place in his heart to covet and desire something that is not his. Since he knows that God did not want to give it to him [and that] he is not able to take it with his power and thoughts and machinations. Hence, he will trust in his Creator, that He will provide for him and that He will do what is good in His eyes. And behold, the commentary on the Ten Commandments is completed...."

And his proof is (in Genesis 38:20, where it states), gedi of the goats - for what [else] is the need for its qualification? But it is not like this, as only something from the species of goats is called a gedi. And in Arabic, it is [also] gedi, and it is not said for another species [besides goats]. However there is a difference between gedi and gedi of the goats; as the gedi is bigger than the gedi of the goats, such that [the latter] still needs to be with the [adult] goats. Hence, gedi and gedi of the goats. And the Sages received a tradition that Jews not eat meat with milk (as well as not to cook meat with milk). And now I will explain: You should know that the custom of the Torah is to speak about what is common. [For example with,] \"the daughter of an ostrich\" (Leviticus 11:16), why did Scripture alter it to say it like this? And does the daughter encompass the whole species? And we have not found it like this [with other species]. You should know that ostrich meat is dry like wood; and [so] it is not customary for people to eat it, as it has no moisture in it. And the only thing that is eaten from all of the species is the daughter - since it is female and young, it has a bit of moisture. But the young male does not. Likewise, people do not eat meat with milk, as it is not a pleasant food. As meat only gets cooked after a long time, and milk is not [quick to cook]; such that it is not the custom in the lands of Yishmael to this day for people to eat veal cooked in milk. [This is] because there is much moisture in veal, like there is [also] in milk, and so it is injurious - hence it is not eaten. But because gedi meat does not have moisture and it is warm when it is young, they therefore cook it in milk. And do not wonder, on account of it not being the custom of the people in these places to eat the gedi of the goats. For the physicians concur that there is no meat [as good] as it, and they even permit sick people to eat it. And in Spain, the Land of Israel, Persia and Babylonia, they do eat it. This was also the custom of the ancient ones (to eat it): \"Two good gedii of the goats\" (Genesis 27:9); \"and we shall make a gedi of the goats before you\" (Judges 13:15); and the priests eat a gedi of the goats as a sin-offering. And since no one eats raw meat, it is forbidden to cook a gedi in its mother's milk.... And we do not have a need to seek the reason for its prohibition, as it is hidden from the eyes of the ones with understanding. Perhaps it was because it is cruel-hearted to cook a kid in its mother's milk, in the way of \"Do not slaughter a sheep or an ox - it and its child on one day (Leviticus 22:28), and \"do not take the mother upon the young\" (Deuteronomy 22:6). And most people are not accustomed to having sheep, so they buy milk from the marketplace and the milk is from a collection of different sheep. [Hence] maybe the buyer of the gedi will not know where is its mother; and when he buys milk, maybe there is milk there that is from the mother of the gedi that he bought, so he would transgress. And [we are] stringent about any doubt [concerning a law] from the Torah. And behold even the Yishmaelites concur that if a gedi is cooked in its mother's milk, such that the lineage is the same, then [the meat] is more pleasant. And the verse is speaking about what is common. And behold the ancient ones, may their memory be blessed, were stringent to remove any doubt and they forbade [all] meat and milk.
