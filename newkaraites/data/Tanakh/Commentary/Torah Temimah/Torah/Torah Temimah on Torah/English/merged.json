And [even] if they do perform a miracle for him, they will deduct it from his merits.\" Rabbi Ḥanin said, \"What is the verse [that alludes to this]? When Jacob said, '<i>Katonti</i> (I am not worthy) of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which You have shown unto Your servant'\" (Genesis 32:11). <sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> He explains \"<i>katonti</i>,\" as my merits have become small. But ostensibly, this requires [further] study - as note that Ya'akov [only] used this expression out of modesty. So there is no hint here to the diminution of merits. And see Ramban and Maharsha, who have [already] pointed this out. But it appears to me that [its understanding] is according to that which is written in Bava Kamma 50b, \"Anyone who says that the Holy One, blessed be He, is a Relinquisher will have his life relinquished.\" And if so, once Ya'akov said that he was not worthy of all the goodnesses; if so, they could not be done for him for free, but rather his merits [must have been] diminished.</i>"

                    "0": "From where do we derive that we drink four cups of wine at the Pesach [seder]? Rabbi Yohanan said: It  corresponds to the four redemptions: 'I will  take you out;'  'I will save you;' 'I will redeem you;' 'I will take you to me.' Three of these are found in this  verse, and one in the verse immediately following. In all of the decisors and commentators and books of legends that bring this saying, it is brought using the language, \"It corresponds to the four languages of redemption.\" But if we look in the Palestinian Talmud from which the phrase is quoted, the word \"languages\" is missing. Rather it says, \"four redemptions.\" In my view, this is a very significant distinction. For if we understand it according to its plain meaning, the notion of four languages of redemption is not a reason to establish four cups of thanksgiving, since there is but one redemption, whether we speak of it using one word or four.  But if there are four redemptions, then that explains the matter much better, for when we examine it well we find that there are four different ideas expressed in these four terms, and each one  is its own complete idea unto itself and deserving of its own thanksgiving. In the first statement (\"I will take you out\"), we see that the Holy Blessed One took them out from under the labors of the Egyptians, which is to say that God lightened their labors--but they were not freed completely. Then God added to this, \"And I will save you from their servitude,\" which means that they did not serve them at all. But even after these two promises, they were still servants to Pharaoh and had not achieved full redemption.  Thus God added, \"And I will redeem you,\" but even so they were not yet made a special acquisition of the Holy Blessed One, and so God added, \"And I will take you to me to be a people, and I will be God to  you.\" We see that within these sayings are included  separate notions of redemption. The verses continue in a \"not only this, but also this\" fashion--that is to say, not only will I do this, but I will also do this, and not only that, but also this, etc. As such, the simple meaning is revealed: We are obligated to give thanks for each individual act that increased the redemption. And that is why [the Sages] established the four cups of thanksgiving. And why did they not establish a cup for the phrase \"and I will bring you to the land?\" We cannot say that it is because that language is unrelated to the redemption, since they  established a cup for \"and I will take you to me to be a people,\" which is likewise not specifically an aspect of redemption. Rather, the simple answer is that since we are still in exile, and the land is in the hands of foreigners, it is impossible to raise a glass of wine for this. And perhaps, in recognition of this, they established a special cup in the name of Elijah, as a remembrance and hint that we hope for his coming and for the resurrection of the nation and the land speedily in our days."

                    "0": "But the offerings themselves, the women do indeed bring them. The explanation is not that women may not, but rather that they are not obligated, as is explained in Chagiga 15b that women would indeed lay their hands on [Rambam 3:8 Laws of Offerings does not make this point explicit]. But as emissaries of their husbands they indeed would be prohibited, as will be explained in verse 4, on the phrase \"he lays his hand\", and see Tosafot on Mas. Rosh Hashana 33a. Similarly, the gemara exempts women from all of the various actions of the offering - the waving, approaching, kamitza, incense offering, slitting, blood-receing, and springkling - since for all of these the verse states \"the sons of Israel/Aaron\" and the sages extrapolate this to mean, \"and not the daughters of Israel/Aaron.\" Tosafot question this, and ask why the sages needed to exclude women from all of these [based on these verses]; they should already be excluded based on the broad principle of \"positive time-bound commandments\", as these actions only take place during the day, as we learn in the verse at the end of Parshat Tzav. But I do not understand this; what did Tosafot see to ask such a question?! The essential act of bringing an offering itself only happens during the day, and yet once we have seen that the Torah empowers women to bring offerings like men, then clearly the Torah has obligated them in the mitzvah of offerings even though it is a time-bound mitzvah! And therefore, one in fact would've assumed that they are similarly obligated in all of the constituitive elements of the offering, and there would not have been a logical reason to exempt them from the details when they are obligated in the general action....     And as for the general principle that women are obligated in offerings like men: the source is in Torat Cohanim, Parshat Emor (22:18) -  איש איש מבית ישראל ומן הגר בישראל אשר יקריב קרבנו לכל נדריהם וגו', בישראל לרבות נשים ועבדים - And similarly explains the Rambam in Hil. Korbanot, 3:2. \"Men, women, and slaves all bring offerings.\" The Kessef Mishna writes by way of finding a source for the Rambam, \"It is obvious that the Torah equates men and women for every rule of the Torah, and we've already said that women do not lay their hands, nor perform the wave-offerings, etc - only men do these things - this implies that women do, however, bring offerings, and every mitzvah that a women is obligated in, so too are slaves.\" Behold, according to the source in Torah Cohanim that we cited - it is shocking to see the lenghty description [of the Kessef Mishna], who is trying to find a source for the words of the Rambam based on talmudic inferences. But the source is plain, obvious, and well understood! He should have simply noted the citation in the Torat Cohanim, and nothing further."

It seems to me that this characteristic is rightly described as being that of a snake, whose poison is weakened by its strike. That is also the intended message in our context.  Even though it is appropriate for a Talmid Chacham to begrudge and take vengeance on those who molest him, for the sake of the honor and standing of the Torah, such acts need to be in the style of the snake, whose effect weakens over time."

This conclusion does not present a difficulty because the intent for which are obligated to observe God's Mitzvoth is only as they are \"Royal Ordinances\" and not because of the reason deduced [from them].  Were that the case, it would be [too] possible to stray from the true path by relying on the reasoning and inclination of each individual, as it is written in Tractate Sanhedrin (21b), \"Why are the reason for Mitzvoth of the Torah not revealed? Because the two instances in which the reasons were revealed led the Gadol Haolam (King Solomon) to stumble\". "
