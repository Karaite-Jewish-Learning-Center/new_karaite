Nevertheless, we find here that the excision of the one who defiles the Mikdash is called death.<br> The explanation for this is that it is also dealing with women, and both a woman and her progeny are not cut off, for the sons will not die because of their mother.<br> Therefore, the main warning here is regarding the death of the transgressor himself."
