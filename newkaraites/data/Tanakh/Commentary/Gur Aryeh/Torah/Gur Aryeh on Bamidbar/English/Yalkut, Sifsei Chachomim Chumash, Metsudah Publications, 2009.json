In these cases the commandment depends on doing and not on study. The language of ‘statute’ is not appropriate in conjunction with Torah, though, because study is a part of the Torah. Here, however, Moshe was told that even concerning Torah there would be a statute — the statute of the Torah — and he should not question the Torah of the red heifer. Regarding the instructions about the vessels taken in the war on Midyan it also says, “the statute of the Torah,” because there was no need to provide a reason in that situation. Furthermore, in that case it was Elozor speaking, and he did not need to provide a reason, but here it was the Holy One speaking. When Rashi writes that this commandment is a decree, he does not mean a decree without any reason, as the view of the Rambam. Rashi only means that we should not say the commandments are due to Hashem’s mercy on His creatures, and this is because the entire Torah is the Attribute of Judgment. All the commandments are for the benefit of the people who keep them, and not, for example, for the benefit of the poor. Hashem commanded us to go in His ways, which are merciful, and that is because of His decrees on mankind and not out of His mercy on creation."

Furthermore, because of (Bereishis 27:22), The voice is the voice of Yaakov; through their synagogues and academies of Torah study, the enemies of Yisroel have no effect on them and are unable to harm them."
