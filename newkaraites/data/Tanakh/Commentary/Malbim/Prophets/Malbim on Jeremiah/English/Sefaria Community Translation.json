A dear son is a grown man who has many virtues and is dear to because of those virtues, and even if he sins, his father still loves him because he'll remember his virtues and be dear to him.  So too, in Egypt, when Israel had no virtue or wholeness, they were like a little tyke in God's eyes, as it is written \"when Israel was a youth I loved him.\"  When they were in the wilderness and in the Land of Israel in the early years, they were like a dear son, because they had among them prophets, holy ministers and sages, and then if they sinned, God remembered the righteous among them and forgave their sin.  But now \"Ephraim is a dear son to me\" - behold he has no dearness or importance, and so too \"he is a little tyke\" -- behold he is not a boy but he has already reached old age, and the parallel statements \"Ephraim is a dear son to me...whenever I have turned on him, I remember him even more (every utterance that has the letter bet after it is a reproach) that so too whenever I speak any defamation \"I will surely remember\" his virtues because he is dear.  \"he is a little tyke...that is why my heart yearns for him\" that my heart will yearn on account of him and \"I will surely have mercy\" because he is a small boy, I will play with him, and and if so, how can you ask that I do something miraculous and love you as in the days of old?"
