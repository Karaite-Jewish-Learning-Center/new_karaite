In the early days (which were better than these), I was silent about my guards in the Kingdom of Portugal, the land of my birth, addressed my mouth to G-d to interpret these four volumes for I had seen there the interpretations were sparse. The debts of the king and his officers wove a yoke upon my neck that I could not meet, until the hand of G-d meddled with me.

When I came there, I was like a strange in the land, a guest searching for a place to rest. I understood that G-d was telling me to complete my ???? and I interpreted the three first volumes, Joshua, for G-d had delivered me and saved me from the sword of Pharoah, and Judges for G-d judged on Earth to decide my cases, and fight my fights with a violent thief and Samuel, for from G-d I have been answered.
