And observe this story, and see how it indicates this concept: For behold, Scripture mentioned [that] the reason of, \"And the Philistines stopped up all the wells which his father’s servants had dug in the days of his father Abraham,\" was in order that Issac's shepherds should not benefit from them, and go away from there from lack of water; and besides that, Abimelech told Issac, \"Go away from us, for you have become far too big for us,\" meaning [that] due to the large quantity of his livestock, there was no room for the livestock of the land; [such that] behold, Issac left the land - but he did not distance himself from the city [of Gerar]. As he dwelt in Nachal Gerar, close to the city - and not like Rashi wrote - as since it shares the name Gerar, it appears that it was close to it. [Hence] he dwelt there against their will. Moreover, he returned and dug the wells that Abraham had dug and the Philistines had filled. And in order to govern over them more, he called them by the name his father had called them - to indicate that they were not new. Rather he would open the wells that they had already filled and call them by their names - as he did this by the power of his hand. And they also dug and found a spring of living water... and even though the shepherds of Gerar fought about this well... behold, this well nevertheless stayed with the shepherds of Issac... And they also dug another well - and even though they also fought about it, it stayed with him; and he called it Sitnah, to [mark] their hatred (sinah) towards him. Until, when they dug the third well, they did not fight about it; and he therefore called its name, Rechovot - as Issac said, \"the Lord has widened (hirchiv) and made us fruitful in the land.\" [This] means to say, \"Even though they sent me away from them, the Lord widened it for us in this land, against their will.\" And this is the reason for all of this story - about which Ramban did not find any purpose or glory to Issac - being written here. [However, Ramban] maneuvered to explain it by way of [its] shell [to be] about our holy and glorious Temple. But in my opinion, there is great glory to Issac [in this story], and that is why it is written here. And since Issac did all of these things with a bold heart - as if he was the master of the land - hence in his coming to Beersheba, the Lord appeared to him and promised him, \"I am the Lord of Abraham, your father, do not fear.\" [This] means to say, \"I am the One who gave Abraham your father the power to defeat the kings, and I am the One who gave you the power to act with strength; hence do not fear the men of Gerar, nor about the matter of the wells that you made - as I am with you in all that you do\"... \n\"We did not touch you and we sent you away in peace\" - meaning to say that we did not take anything from all that is yours, but we rather sent you away in peace. As there is no doubt that you are now more blessed of the Lord than when you came to our land. And that proves that you received benefit and goodness in this land, even as it was from God. And therefore, it is not fit that you do harm to the land in which you lived and were blessed."

                    "16": "From \" And Yaakov came complete to the town of Shechem etc.\" until \"And Chamor, the father of Shechem came out\" - Shechem is apparently the city that is close to Mamre Kiriat Arba, since behold when Yaakov was dwelling in Hevron that is Kiriat Arba his sons were sheparding the sheep in Shechem. And it is logical that there was between them a distance of a day maximum, and that is why Yaakov sends  [Yosef] to see how the brothers are faring, and the sheep too, and this was when he is close to where his father was. Despite this, the place where Dina was subjugated was far away from Hevron, where Yitzchak was, and this is a question that remains, since Chazal said that Shechem was a place ready for punishment, since there they subjugated Dina and the tribes were damaged. And from this it appears to me that Shechem was the name of the entire place, and Chamor was the prince of all that land [Abarbanel goes to show where he thinks the connection between Shalem, Shechem and Hevron is]... and the issue with Dina happened in a town named Shalem at the beginning, and it is in a corner of the place called Shechem, and the sons of Yaakov were pasturing the sheep in a different corner, farther away from that area... And it is said that \"Yaakov put his tent in front of the city\" to explain that there were other reasons for this issue [of Dina] to happen: the first one is that Yaakov pitched [his encampment] close to the city, and because of this Dina went out to see the daughters of the land, and if he had pitched in a place farther away, closer to the place of pasturing and farther from the city, Dina would not have come out and what happened would not have happened. Second reason, Yaakov had bought the piece of land where her tent was pitched from Chamor the father of Shechem, and the scripture teaches this by saying that at first he set his tent on the field, and then after the owners complained, he bought that piece of the field, since he did not want to rent it. And since he purchased it from the hand of Chamor, the prince of the land, it makes sense that he paid good money for it, since a prince of the land will not sell parts of his estate to a stranger unless he gave a princely sum. And he did not buy it from the hand of the sons of Chamor, his advanced age prevented him himself to go, but his sons went to make the sale, and this is why they went to the tents of Yaakov, and saw Dina there, and there is no doubt that they spoke with her and the soul of Shechem desired her, and this too was the reason of the continuation [of what happened] when she went out to see the daughters of the land. And this answers the second question. And Ibn Ezra already explained that Yaakov stayed in this city for many years, since Dina was seven years old when she arrived there, and Shimon and Levi were lads. Since Yaakov had entered the holy land, it was for this reason that he bought a piece of the field and became property owner of holy land, and he acquired an altar to praise G-d, that in His great compassion and love brought him to His land and saved him from Lavan... [Abarbanel goes into a discussion on the nature of Judaism, the name E-l and more] And maybe even this altar was a reason for what happened, since once it was ready all his children came to eat from the sacrifices and Shechem and all the town came to see the inauguration of the altar, and saw Dina there, and desired her, and what happened happened once she went out to see the daughters of the land - and this explains the third question. The Torah does not bring the phrase \"and Dina came out\" to criticize Dina as a \"self-exposing daughter of a self-exposer; like mother, like daughter\" as Rashi z\"l has. Leah was a modest woman, to the point that Yaakov did not see anything until the moment he came to her. And the \"Leah went out\" really means that she went out just to the door of her tent and she went out joyfully and with holy intent to greet her husband Yaakov and from that came the birth of Yissachar, the tribe of modest Torah teachers. Also, one cannot say that she is called \"daughter of Leah\" as a criticism of her nature being of \"self-exposing\", since Leah was taught to stay in the tents, and Rachel was the one out with the sheep. And from Yaakov himself was known to be a modest person, hiding in the tents of scholars, and if he was modest like this, all the more his daughter. The intent wasnot for anything bad, as the text says \"daughters of the town\" and not sons of the town. Dina had no sisters, being the only maiden in the house and so she went out to see how the girls of the town dressed and used jewelry, and this explains our fourth question. And there is no doubt that she did not went out by herself, without the company of a man or a woman, and this is implied, just as the scripture has regarding Moses, that he went out to meet his father-in-law, and obviously he did not go alone. The text describes that Shechem was \"the son of Chamor the Hivite, the prince of the land\" to make sure that we understand that being the prince of the land he used force, and had no fear of those who were with Dinah or of the sons of Yaakov. And the text goes on to say, like Rashi explains, that he lay with her in the usual fashion and afflicted her in the unusual fashion, and how can one describe his doing such a disgrace. And Ibn Ezra explains that her being a virgin, and he doing three things - seizing her by force while she was passing through the market, forcing her in the natural way and in the unnatural way.And even if you know about the second thing, why is the text bringing the first? Isn't it already included? This is to teach that even if he wanted to have relations with her due to his wanting her as a wife, one cannot do this by force. The second comes to teach that he destroyed her virginity. And why is it explaining that he afflicted her? To explain that she did not go by her own will, but he hoped that it would being by her being forced and end by her wanting it.[...]"

For if the second set of tablets were to replace the first set, it would be appropriate for them to be identical in all respects; however, the first set were both carved and inscribed by God, while the second set were carved by Moses, who did not inscribe them, and inscribed by God, who did not carve them.",

God also said, \"I will proclaim the Name of the Lord before you, and the grace that I grant and the compassion that I show,\" which are the three attributes (God, Compassion, Grace) and no others.  Yet, at the moment of action, He proclaimed thirteen attributes.  And so He added upon his promise.

Note that in reference to the \"standing\" the verse did not say \"before him\", only that He stood there.  Indeed, in reference to His passing the verse says \"before him.\"  And pay no mind to the teaching that explains that the phrase \"the Lord passed before him\" means that, in response to Moses' desire to see the Lord's face, the Lord changed the subject by enumerating the attributes, for this is not supportable from the grammar or the context.

But calling out the Lord's honored name is not speaking down.

And the Psalmist said, \"the iniquities of my youth and my sins do not remember.\" And erase the crime.  Why did each one of these complete Sages independently invoke the erasure of crimes?

For on the day that Moses initially descended, he destroyed the tablets, and the verse (Exodus 32) then states, \"On the following day, Moses said to the nation, 'You have sinned\" ... and now I will ascend to the Lord and will stand and pray there forty more days until your sins are forgiven.\"  On his second descent, the verse states, \"Moses awoke in the morning,\" it was four months and four days from the sixth day of Sivan (the date of Moses' first ascent) to Yom Kippur, which was on the tenth day of Tishrei.  And the order of the verses here supports this timeline.  Additionally, we have the verse from Deuteronomy (5:15) where Moses recounts three times that he stood upon Mt. Sinai, forty days each time, as it states, \"As I ascended to the mountain ... and I stayed upon the mountain forty days and forty nights.\"  And the Lord gave me the two tablets of stone, and this is the first stay upon the mountain.  Afterwards, the verse states, \"I prostrated before the Lord as I did the first time, forty days and forty nights ... for all of your sins,\" and this is the second stay upon the mountain (and with respect to this, Moses also said, \"I prostrated myself before the Lord forty days and forty nights that I prostrated ...\" which are the days of the second ascent, which is recounted again so that Moses could share the prayer that he prayed at that time.  Afterwards he said, \"At that time, the Lord said to me, 'Carve for yourself two tablets of stone similar to the first ones' ... and I stood upon the mountain as I did the first time, for forty days and forty nights. And this was the third stay upon the mountain. \"And He answered,\" and with this answer the forgiveness was completed... And God said to Moses, \"Carve for yourself,\" to inform him that he would not merit the complete vision of the testimony except through the Torah which was given by his hands, for without this Moses would not have achieved this level of spiritual greatness.  And the reason for the word \"yourself\" was to warn Moses that he himself, and no other, should carve the tablets.  For the word \"yourself\" connotes isolation, as it was written [with respect to Abraham], \"Go yourself from your land ...\" that Abraham should go without his father or relatives (as explained there).  Similarly [with respect to the spies sent to Canaan], \"Send for yourself men ...\" that Moses should send them alone, apart from the rest of the nation.  And here, God saw that the tablets encompassed two miraculous qualities.  The first was that the workmanship was divine work, done in a miraculous fashion, and the second was the inscription, which was divinely written.  When Moses shattered the tablets, the workmanship and form was lost, but the words inscribed were not destroyed or lost. Therefore, God commanded Moses to carve the stone to make new tablets, ready to be inscribed, for it was Moses' obligation since he destroyed the first set of tablets.  However, He said the inscription would not be written by Moses, because he did not destroy "

And the reason is that animals that possess these signs generally have flesh that is pleasant for human consumption, because the cause for bringing up the cud is that the animal does not have molars in its upper jaw to grind its food, and on this account, it cannot eat bones, but only grasses, which it swallows whole, and when they are softened in the belly by the natural heat, it brings them up through its throat and grinds them with its jaws and swallows them a second time.  And these species of animals are fat and good for human consumption, because they find own food everywhere, and their temperamental mixture is more even, because they feed on grasses, both moist and dry, and because of this, these animals are not cruel, carnivorous, or wicked."

                    "1": "Regarding the Torah's prohibition of foods, many of the commentators have thought that it is because of the body's health and medical care, those foods being bad, and generating a harmful moistness.  This is the view of the Ramban, on the verse, \"these you shall abhor among the birds\" (Lev. 11:13).  But God forbid that I should believe this, because if that were the case, the divine Sefer Torah would be on the level of a minor book among the books of medicine -- short in both words and reasoning.  And this is not the way of the divine Torah, or the depth of its purpose.  Further, we can see with our own eyes that the nations that eat the flesh of the pig, the creepers, the mouse, and the other impure birds, beasts, and fish are all alive to this day, \"firm as a mirror of cast metal\" (Job 37:18), and there is none tired or weak among them.  Also, there are other animals that are well known to be harmful, like the viper, snake, serpent, and scorpion, that are not mentioned here among the category of prohibitions.  And there are also grasses and plants that are very injurious and deadly poisonous, like the alisor and its like, among those mentioned by the medical experts, and the Torah does not prohibit their consumption.  And all of this shows that the divine Torah does not come to heal the bodies, or to seek their health, but rather to promote the health of the soul and to heal its ailments, and therefore, it forbade foods that sully and abominate the pure and sublime soul, and that engender in the human temperamental mixture an impenetrability and a distortion of desires, by creating a bad mixture that gives rise to a spirit of pollution that defiles the mind and the deeds, and that expels the spirit of purity and holiness for which David prayed: \"Do not take Your holy spirit away from me\" (Ps. 51:13).  And he said \"Fashion a pure heart for me, O God; create in me a steadfast spirit\" (id. 12).  And it was because of this that He, may He be blessed, said, \"You shall not draw abomination upon yourselves through anything that swarms; you shall not make yourselves impure therewith\" (Lev. 11:43).  For in this consists the idea of impenetrability and impurity.  And Scripture does not call them \"injurious\" or \"disease-causing,\" but \"impure\" and \"abominable,\" showing that the rationale for the prohibition is on account of the soul and not on account of the body and its health.  It was necessary for the wholeness, clarity, and purity of the soul that the bodily temperament would be right, and that its food would create blood that was pure and refined, and not gross and thick and not right, as would be created by the forbidden foods.  And also the forbidden foods were related to the idolaters.  And even today in the land of India, it is forbidden to eat from the herd or from the flock, as the Master [Rambam] says in his Guide.  And in other countries, they eat forbidden foods because of their religion, and that is why these foods are called \"abominations,\" as idolatry is called \"abomination.\"  "

And let him 'not be scared and not tremble' 'from the plague that stalks in the darkness, or the scourge that ravages at noon' (according to Psalms 91:6).

And also the scouts in their answers did not respond to this at all. But [rather], Moshe in his knowing the evil of the people, [understood] that there was to know whether the land was good and broad, plentiful of food and plentiful of settlement, in [such] a way that they would eat and be satiated and greatly delight upon it. And [so] he commanded them the two questions about the inhabited land and the two last questions about the land that is worked and sown. However, the other two questions Moshe invented himself, to ask about them. And this was in order that they know that the enemies were a large and strong nation and that the cities were fortified into the skies; and with this, they would recognize and know that their Savior is strong, and that it would not be with their [own] strength that they would inherit the land, and that their forearms would not deliver them. And hence they would increase their clinging to God, may He be blessed, and call to Him, 'since it is a time of trouble for Yaakov and from it he shall be delivered.' Behold, it has become clear from this that Moshe did not ask about the land, \"whether it is good or bad,\"  because of his being in doubt about the divine designs - God forbid - but rather to answer their questions, in his thinking that for this did they request to send scouts, as I elucidated; and that he only asked them, \"are they strong or weak, are they few or are they many,\" in order to sway their hearts to return to God and to supplicate in front of Him, 'since to God is deliverance,' and that they should say, \"Let us go and return to God,  so that He should do with us all of His wonders,\" and like he did at the [Reed] Sea. And it appears to me in truth that our master, Moshe, sinned in these first two questions that he asked about the people and the cities, as Israel did not ask them and also God, may He be blessed,  did not command about them, but [rather] he asked them on his own. And there is no doubt that his intention was good, but there came out from it what came out - 'like an error that goes out in front of the ruler.'

And the philosophers already thought that it was [necessary] and that the dominion of a king to a politically organized nation is like the relationship of the heart to the body of a living being that has a heart, and like the relationship of the First Cause to the world more generally. And even though these analysts reason that monarchy insures three things – the first being unity and the absence of [division], the second being continuity and the lack of [instability], and the third being absolute power – [in fact], their thinking about the obligation and necessity of a king is actually false. [This] since it is not to be denied that there can be many leaders of the people that gather and unite and agree upon one policy and that the leadership and law be according to them – and this goes against the first [claim]. And why should their leadership not be [for] one year or three years like the years of an employee or less? And when the turn of other 'judges and officers' arrives, they will rise instead of them and faithfully investigate the sin of the first ones, and that which they condemn must pay all that they have done badly – and this goes against the second [claim]. And why should their power also not be limited, as with religions and mores [– and this goes against the third claim]. And logic dictates that when an individual [disagrees] with a group, the law follows the group. And it is more likely that the lapse be with one man – as it stated (Proverbs 16:14), “The king’s wrath is a messenger of death” - than it be that the many would trespass when they take counsel together. As if one strays from the path, the others will protest against him. And since their leadership is temporary and they will have to be accountable after a 'few days,' that fear of flesh and blood is upon them. And why do we need to bring theoretical claims for this, as behold, experience trumps modeling: Look and see the lands the leadership of which is with kings, and [by contrast,] today we have seen many lands the leadership of which is is with temporary judges and leaders that are chosen among them and the King God is with them. Their law is refined by ordered limits, and [their leaders] are the ones that control the people that make the matters of war; none can stand in front of them – not from a tribe, and not from his land. Did you not know, did you not hear that a great land governed over the whole world, consumed the whole earth – search it and note it – while its leadership was through the Councils, that were wholesome and many and their leadership was temporary. However, afterward they were made a tributary. And also today, the Commonwealth of Venice, that great mistress among the nations, the rulers over states; and the Country of Florence, the beauty of all the lands; and other countries small and large are run by the mouth of leaders elected for set periods of time. And behold, the elected governments have 'in them nothing perverse or crooked' – no one raises his hand or foot to [do] a wrongful thing – and they conquer lands that are not theirs with wisdom, understanding and knowledge. And all of this shows that the presence of a king is not necessary for a nation, and like the teacher of the Guide (Maimonides) mentioned. And it is a wonder about this supposed opinion, that compares the unity of a [human] king over the control and will of people to the unity of the ancient necessary First Cause, may He be blessed. However, [even] in an animal body, the sages have already written that there are three main organs in its governance. And even according to the opinion of the head of the philosophers that only the heart is the main [one], behold, this is concerning the generation of the spirit, but it does not contradict that the government of the living faculties is from the brain, and the natural ones is from the liver. In the final analysis, it is impossible for natural matters not to be like this; as from the act of [Divine] will, they are [only] from the substance of that [which] is possible - ‘how can straw be compared to grain?’ And one should not ask from the statement (Proverbs 28:2), “When there is rebellion in the land, its ministers are many,” as there it is speaking about ministers, not about leaders and judges. And how will we [miss] that which is well-known among all, that when the leaders are good, it is better that they be many; and if they are bad, it is more dangerous. And therefore, I think that the kings were not set up with the examination of the people at first, and as it is written (Isaiah 7:6), “We will march against Yehudah and invade it […], and we will set up a king in it.” And even if they were only appointed by way of trustees to serve the people, and they are made masters, as if God, may He be blessed, gave them the ‘land and its fullness’; and they bequeathed it to their sons after them forever, as if it was land that he bought with his money, this too is ‘not worthwhile (literally, the same)’ with all reigns, as there will be kings that do not have leadership abilities. And this is the First Introduction.  "
