G-d's knowledge does not impinge on free will, because his knowledge stems not (in the same way as the) knowledge of man which comes from his senses, rather it is He alone who perceives, as is explained in the Rambam. Behold it is not in our ability to understand how this works...rather this we know:  Free will is a condensation of G-dliness, because G-d provides place for his creations to do as they choose, and removed from their actions, the decree and the decision on an individual level...The torah speaks in the way that people speak - let us leave a place for man's personal choice, that he won't be forced in any of his actions, and in the obligation of his thoughts, to be free to do good or evil as he desires.  He will be able to do things against his more natural state, and against those things which are straight in the eyes of G-d....."

And he should take a wife from there [for Issac], even if she is not from his family, as long as she is from that city. And hence he said that the maiden in whom he will see generosity to toil and water his camels is fit to get married to the son of Abraham. And it would certainly find favor in the eyes of the maiden and her father to marry into [the family of] Abraham. So there was no divination. It was only because Eliezer wanted to substantiate it for [Rebecca's family], that it was a certain decree and providence, [that] he said that Abraham commanded him to take [a wife] from his family and from the house of his father... And hence he also changed this, [to say] that he did not give her the bracelets until he asked, \"Whose daughter are you?\" As since, according to his words [here], the command from Abraham was only about his family, who would know if she was from his family [without asking her]? But in truth, Abraham only commanded him about the city in which he was born. And hence he gave [the bracelets] before he asked, \"Whose daughter are you?\" As whoever she was, she should marry the son of Abraham... And according to this, he did not divine what he said to them, to divine that she was from Abraham's family - like he had said before this, that he was also commanded about this by Abraham..."

And furthermore a murderer in exile always hopes that perhaps the anointed Cohen will die and he will be free with his death. But Hashem had said that Elazar [the kohen gadol] would be present for the dividing of the land. Consequently, the murderer has no hope of returning until the land will be settled. Therefore in such a situation where he has no hope of returning immediately the Torah did not require exile."
