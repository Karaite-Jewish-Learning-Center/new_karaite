Note the word דרש in original Rashi) but I do not understand why he has not followed the simple reading: \"Lest they profane My holy name\" - [After the fact that] they sanctify me through their prayers and sacrifices, and if they were to touch the holy sacrifices when they were impure they would be desecrating my holy name and all their worship would be in vain. This explains the depth of Isaiah's complaints when he says, \"[Woe is me; I am dead! ...] I live among a people of unclean lips; [yet] my own eyes have beheld [the King] Lord of Hosts\" (Isaiah 6:5) and he fears for his life (see Rashi there)."
