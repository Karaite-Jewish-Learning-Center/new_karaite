There are 25 (<i>gematriya</i> of כה) letters in the verse of <i>Shema Yisrael.</i> The language of blessing and peace is used in the Torah 25 times. Therefore, the blessing of the <i>kohanim</i> begins with the language of blessing and concludes with peace. This is hinted at in the verse, “Hashem shall <b>bless</b> His people with <b>peace</b>” (Tehillim 29:11)."
