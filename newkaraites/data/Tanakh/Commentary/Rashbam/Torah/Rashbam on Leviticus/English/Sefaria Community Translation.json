Thus, it speaks in euphemistic language, \"without having rinsed 'his hands' in water.\"  For if he did not scrub his flesh well, and the opening of the penis that was stopped up, as is explained in Tractate Niddah, even though he immersed, he remains impure because he did not scrub well before the immersion, and anyone who touches him will be impure.  And because it is natural that the discharge emerges from the opening of the penis and needs to be scrubbed, it speaks with the expression of rinsing the hands as an analogy, like what is written about the prostitute (Prov. 30:20), \"She eats, wipes her mouth, And says, 'I have done no wrong.'\"  And likewise (Jud. 3:24), \"He was 'anointing his legs'\" because it refers to going outside.
