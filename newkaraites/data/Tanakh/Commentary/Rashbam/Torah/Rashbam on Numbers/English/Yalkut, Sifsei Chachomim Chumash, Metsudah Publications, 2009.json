There, he took a woman to be queen but never had conjugal relations with her. Miriam and Aharon, however, did not know that he never had relations with her when they spoke about him. This is the main explanation according to the plain meaning. If, however, one were to assert they were speaking about Tzipora, why does the verse need to explain that she was a Cushite woman? Haven’t we already been informed that Tzipora was a Midyanite? Moreover, it can be asserted that Tzipora was not a Cushite at all, because Cush was one of the sons of Cham, and Midyan was one of the sons of Ketura and Avraham."
