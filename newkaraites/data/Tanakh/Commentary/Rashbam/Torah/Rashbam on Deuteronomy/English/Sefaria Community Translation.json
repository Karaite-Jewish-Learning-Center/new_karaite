And it similarly states and repeats and reiterates this matter when Moshe comes to elaborate the commandments (Deut. 4:45-46):  \"these are the decrees, laws, and rules that Moses addressed ... beyond the Jordan, in the valley at Beth-peor, in the land of King Sihon of the Amorites.\"  [And (Deut. 1:5) \"On the other side of the Jordan, in the land of Moab,] Moses undertook [to expound this Teaching.]",

And if the meaning of the final mem were like \"otam\" [\"them\"] [i.e., a pronominal object suffix], it should have written \"v'hamamam.\"  However, from the root heh-mem-heh, [the basis of] \"yehemeh libi\" (Jer. 48:36 [reversed]), one could say \"v'hamam,\" [i.e.,] \"v'hamah otam,\" as from \"asah\" [he made], [we derive] \"otz'bi asam\" (Isa. 48:5 -- \"my idol made them\"), and from \"When Ya'akov saw [ra'ah]\" (Gen. 29:10) [we derive] \"And Ya'kov said when he saw them (ra'am)\" (Gen. 32:3) -- \"ra'ah otam.\"  And \"hamam\" from the root h-m-h would be explained \"hamah otam.\"  And if you say that this [the actual word in our verse] should also be interpreted as \"hamah otam,\" you can't say that, because the word himyon [making a loud noise] is intransitive:  \"My mind yehemeh like a harp\" (Jer. 48:36, modified) -- of its own.

Moshe said to them, \"Prayer will not be efficacious in the Land of Israel. Currently, your sins are atoned for so that His name will not be profaned. For this is what I prayed (vv. 27-18): 'Give thought to Your servants, etc. Else the country from which You freed us will say, \"It was because Adonai was powerless to bring them.\"' That is why you were not liable for death on account of it. But after He kills 31 kings and gives their property to you, then He will expel you and exile you from the land, for there will not be any desecration of the name, in saying to the nations that it was because Adonai was powerless.\" Instead, the nations will say that Israel sinned against Him, as is set out in Atem Nitzavim (Deut. 29:23-27): \"All nations will ask, 'Why did the LORD do thus to this land? Wherefore that awful wrath?' etc., They will be told, 'Because they forsook the covenant that the LORD, God of their fathers, etc., The LORD uprooted them from their soil in anger, fury, and great wrath, and cast them into another land, as is still the case.'\""
