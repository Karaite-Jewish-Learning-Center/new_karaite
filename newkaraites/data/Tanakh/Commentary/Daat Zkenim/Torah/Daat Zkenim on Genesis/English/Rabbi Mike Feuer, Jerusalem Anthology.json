It is called that because it became a mountain out of fear (yirah) – at first it was a valley but it immediately became a high, steep, lofty mountain. Furthermore, it was originally called Shalem, as it says “Melchitzedek, king of Shalem…” (Bereshit 14:18) but Avraham called it yireh, therefore it is now called Yerushalayim which contains within it both yireh and Shalem.",
