And what he said between azure and white rd between azure in the tzitzit and white in it. And I knew the green. And at the end of the reading, Rabbi Eliezer knew up to the hot hawk and Rabbi Yehoshua until three hours Anyone who does not get up from bed until three hours of the day are kings and therefore it can happen until the end of the third hour. And know that all the hours mentioned in each sub-section are the temporal hours and the temporal matter is the hours that have twelve hours a day and twelve hours at night and what He said for up to three hours as if he had said one day to brides a quarter that was the day to day Tammuz period or Tevet period and that was what was said and what he said did not lose Rl did not lose blessings but congratulates creator and love and read Kash and even other (six) [three] hours of the day but hired on that matter as one who reads in Torah not as one who reads K \"Q in her season and from here you learned that the QS reader in her season hired a multitude of readers in the Torah. And there is no Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua and it is he who has forgotten but in the beginning he must aim to complete her reading with the hot hawk."
