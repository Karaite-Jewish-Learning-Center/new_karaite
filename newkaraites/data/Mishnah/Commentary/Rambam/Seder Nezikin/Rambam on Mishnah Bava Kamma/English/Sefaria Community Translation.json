                "1": "These 4 principal categories of damage are those which relate to a person’s property.  The meaning of ‘the cow’ implies the legs of the cow as it damages by trampling and destroys and ruins as it walks along with its feet.  And the ‘maaveh’ implies the tooth, that it damages by eating.  The reason damage through eating is called ‘tooth’ is that this is something which it seeks out for itself, what it wants to eat, as it says (Obadia 1:6) “How has Esau been searched, his hordes ransacked”.",
                "2": "“The cow is not like the maaveh”",
                "3": "Implying that it was necessary for the Torah to list each of these 4 categories of damage separately because it is impossible to derive one from the other with a ‘lesser to more severe’’ exegesis. As each one has a principle in it which is not in the other, therefore comparison is not appropriate.  That damage with the foot is common is not comparable to damage with the tooth which is not common.  And damage with the tooth that is done on account of benefit is not comparable to damage done with the foot which is not done for benefit.  And neither of these which involve living creatures are comparable to fire which is not living.  And each of these (foot, tooth, and fire) which go forth to damage are not comparable to the pit which does not go forth to damage.  Therefore each of these has a principle which is not found in the others and it’s necessary for the Torah to explain for each one of them that they are obligated in damages.  And this is not to say that if the Torah wrote the law of pit and one of the other three that we would not be able to learn out the other two from the exegesis of ‘common principle’ as is alluded to in the Mishnah.  However they were divided by the Torah into 4 rulings to establish that each one of them has its own specifications.  Tooth and foot are exempt from public domain, pit is exempt from vessels, fire is exempt from concealed items as will all be explained.",
                "4": "And it was not necessary to include the principal category of property damage- ‘‘goring”, because there are differentiations of  (an animal which is) ‘accustomed’ and ‘not accustomed’ as is explained in the Torah (Exodus 21:35).",
                "5": "And the Mishnah says “There is a common principle in them” implying all these things can do damage and you have to guard them, and if they do damage you are obligated to pay for the damage with the best of the land as has been said, “the best of the field and the best of his vineyard he should pay” (Exodus 22:4). And this has been explained in the 5th section of Gittin.",
                "6": "And these are the subcategories of the primary categories: the subcategories of foot are if it damages with its body, or its hair, as it walks along.  The subcategories of tooth are if it rubs against (and damages) a wall for its enjoyment or it spoils fruits for its enjoyment.  The subcategories of fire are if a stone or a knife or a load is placed on the top of a roof, and a typical wind knocks it over and it falls and it damages.  The subcategories of pit are spit and phlegm that comes out from someone.  And these laws will be further explained with their principles and subcategories. "

                "1": "This terminology used of “hechsher” in this Mishnah refers to circumstances that fall into this matter and to it these judgments apply, similar to the explanations at the beginning of (mesechta) eruvin.",
                "2": "And it says ‘All that one is obligated to guard’ that it does not do damage to a person, that thing is prepared that whenever it damages, even if the owner is not aware, to obligate him to pay the damages since he did not guard it and this is the reason we say he enabled the damage, thus he enabled all of it.  If he enables a part of the damage he is obligated in all the damage, as if he enabled all the damage, for example, a pit as is mentioned, is only obligated in damages once it is fit for damage by being 10 handbreadths (deep).  And there is not a difference whether he digs a pit of 10 handbreadths or he dug an (additional) handbreadth from a 9 handbreadths pit to make it 10, that since he has made it appropriate to damage that it is as if he dug it from the beginning, and this is why it says that ‘if he has enabled a part of the damage he is obligated to pay for all damages as he enabled of all the damage’.  ",
                "3": "After this the Tanna gives 5 conditions and says that a man is not obligated to pay for damages caused by his property if one of these 5 conditions is missing: 1) That it is not consecrated, for example, if his cow was a sin offering or a burnt offering and it damages, he is not obligated to pay a thing, and this is what we are referring to when we say it is not ‘meilah’, since if one benefits from consecrated property that he is obligated in meilah (as has been explained in mesechta meilah). 2) That he damages a jew, but if the cow of a jew gores the cow of a canaanite the jew does not need to pay anything as is explained.  3) That those possessions which damage should be identifiable and have an identifiable owner, but if one says it is your cow that damaged and the other said it was your cow that damaged and it is not known which of the cows from them did the damage or if the cow is ownerless and damages, that since it doesn’t have an identifiable owner at the time it damaged there is no owner to be obligated to pay for the damage.  But if someone else acquires the cow which did damage after it damaged, it has the rules of all ownerless property. (ie, the owner of the damaged cow cannot claim a lien on the damaging cow as is the case with owned property, rather anyone can acquire the damaging cow and there is no lien upon it) 4) That the damage was done outside the domain of the damager, but if the cow of Reuven entered the house of Shimon and was damaged, Shimon is not obligated in anything, as he will say to him ‘your cow was in my domain, what was it doing there?’   And if Shimon himself damaged it, that he struck it and it was wounded or died, he is obligated to pay, as he (Reuven) will say to him- ‘you have permission to move him but you do not have permission to damage him’.  5) That the damage happens in an area they both are allowed to be, for example, that there was a field owned by the damager and damagee and the cow of the damager damages the field with the tooth of the foot, they are not obligated in anything.  But if it damages with the horn he is obligated as it’s been explained.  And it’s explained that this is as long as it’s a place that they both own that is set aside for fruits and cows, but if it was specifically for fruits and one of the partners went over and brought his cow in and he damaged with tooth or foot, they are obligated, even though they both have permission to be there.  When all these conditions are complete and there is damage, they are obligated to pay for all the damages with the best of the land. "

                "1": "That since we brought up these instances of damage with the conditions where a man is obligated to pay for all the damages caused by his possessions, and now (the Mishnah) begins to explain how to make payment and says that evaluation of damages should be made in money, and we don’t say take out from this thing (that damaged), for example, if a cow eats fruits we do not say to the owner of the fruits to take out from the cow the portion which he ate for yourself, rather, we assess what he ate for himself in money and we force the owner of the cow to pay. ",
                "2": "And that it says ‘an equivalence of money’ implies that since the court does not say to pay for damages for one who inherits a liability except from land, not from that which is movable, since movable things are themselves money. And says that since they don’t take property unless it is equivalent money, which is land, and this law applies specifically to inheritors, indeed if the damager himself pays his portion that he damaged from moveable objects, the hand of the court will be removed from his land.",
                "3": "And that evaluation and payment will not be made except in a court of experts and not laymen. And the witnesses that are free men and jewish but not the testimony of slaves or gentiles, that it was necessary to exclude them, because you may think to give in and be lenient in testimony for damages, because this is most cases, and it is uncommon that it happens to be there are kosher witnesses because the time of collision between people and between animals is usually in the company of simple people and slaves and gentiles, therefore it lets us know that we only accept in court kosher witnesses as we say with other testimony.",
                "4": "And there is no distinction between men and women in damages whether she damages or gets damaged. ",
                "5": "And what we say that the damagee and the damager share in payment hints to matters where they are obligated in half damages as will be explained that the damager pays half the damage and the damagee will lose half, and this half also will not happen except when full damage applies, implying with witnesses and a court of experts and the possessions of jews and the rest of the conditions, apart from what we said with the best of the land because this is not fitting for half damages as will be explained."
