collection frequency
cf = total number of occurrences of a term in the collection

document frequency
df = total number of documents that contain the term

N = total number of documents in the collection 

idf = log(N/df)

Example :
  N = 806.761
  

  Term  df      idf
  car   18.165  1.65
  auto   6.732  2.08
